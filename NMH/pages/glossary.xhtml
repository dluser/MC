His failure to defend New Mexico against the Army of the West in 1846 tarnished his reputation, but he successfully appealed to Mexico City politicians to recover much of his notoriety. Still, his actions as governor (granting lands to American newcomers) and his retreat in 1846 have made him a much-maligned figure in New Mexico history. </p>

      <p>Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton was an ardent advocate of U.S. westward expansion in the 1830s and 1840s. In the Senate, he used his position of seniority and power to support initiatives that would allow the United States to claim territories between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean.

      <p>Alternatively called the Chimayó Rebellion, the Revolt of 1837, or the guerra de los chimayosos, the 1837 conflict was an outgrowth of the Centralist-Federalst political divides that precipitated Texans to declare independence from Mexico. In New Mexico, grievances were much more localized. Genízaro residents of the Rio Arriba region deeply resented the effort by the Government in Mexico City to impose governors and new taxes on them from afar. In early 1838 Manuel Armijo led the counter revolt that violently quashed the short-lived rebellion. Still, the grievances of northern New Mexicans remained and resurfaced again in the Taos Revolt of 1847.</p>

      <p>During the U.S. Presidential Election of 1844, westward expansion was the major campaign issue for Democrat James K. Polk and Whig Henry Clay. Polk championed expansion on all fronts, making his rallying cry “54° 40’ or fight!” Polk considered his electoral victory to be a mandate in support of Manifest Destiny, and he quickly took actions to foment war with Mexico in order to secure the Mexican territories of California and New Mexico.</p>

At times, family members sent letters to their relatives in other parts of the country or world to promote New Mexico and the West. Because the intention of such literature was to draw people to the territory, the tracts often mischaracterized the area. Booster literature from Columbus, New Mexico, on the U.S.-Mexico border, for example, claimed that underground aquifers provided the town's agriculturists with an "inexhaustible water supply."

In an attempt to resolve tensions in the Mesilla Valley, U.S President Franklin Pierce sent James Gadsden to Mexico City as the new Ambassador to that country with a special charge to negotiate the sale of the Mesilla Strip to the United States. Additionally, Gadsden attempted to purchase large sections of Chihuahua and Sonora, but in the end he was only able to secure the 45,000 square mile tract south of the Gila River. In the Mesilla Treaty that soleminzed the land transfer, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million.

      <p>Much like other Anglo Americans of his day, not long after he moved to Mexico in 1828 he married a woman from Chihuahua and started a family there. Those types of connections helped him to understand the region and its people. In the early 1840s he relocated his family to Peralta, less that twenty miles south of Albuquerque. He was present during the closed-door negotiations between Governor Armijo, Diego de Archuleta, and James Magoffin in the fall of 1846. In 1861 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Connelly as Governor of the New Mexico Territory. Because of his knowledge of the area, when Confederate soldiers threatened New Mexico in 1861 and 1862 he explained the situation to nuevomexicanos in terms they could relate to--the Confederate invasion was essentially a Texan invasion. Such reasoning persuaded many nuevomexicanos to join the Union cause against the Confederacy.</p>

Following the assassination of Reverend Tolby, McPherson wrote numerous other letters to officials in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to force federal action against the Santa Fe Ring. </p>

He also had prior dealings with Billy the Kid. As sheriff, however, his main task was to bring Billy the Kid to justice for his role in the Lincoln County War. After months of pursuit and tense gun battles, Garrett arrested Billy at Stinking Springs (near present-day Taiban, New Mexico). Billy escaped his imprisonment in Lincoln by killing two of Garrett's deputies. On July 14, 1881, Garrett located Billy the Kid at Fort Sumner in the residence of his love interest, Paulita Maxwell. Garrett took Billy by surprise at the Maxwell residence and killed the infamous outlaw. After he killed Billy the Kid, Garrett became famous. Yet he was unable to secure reelection as Lincoln County Sherriff. He later served as Doña Ana County Sheriff and he wrote a biography of Billy the Kid: "The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid." </p>

When it became clear to Cochise that Bascom intended to kill him, he drew a knife and cut his way out of the tent.

      <p>Founded in New York in 1846, the Associated Press (AP) is a consortium of journalists dedicated to breaking important news stories at the national and international levels. Initially, the AP relied on couriers on horseback sponsored by five New York City newspapers to relay news of the U.S.-Mexico War as quickly as possible. As new technologies have developed, including carrier pigeon, railroad, telegraph, steamship, radio, and eventually the internet, the AP has utilized them to convey its reporting on important events. In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the AP helped to create a national sense of community by ensuring that people in all sectors of the United States would receive essentially the same news dispatches.   </p>

As a young woman, she taught in a rural school in Guadalupe County. Her teaching position made her realize how little nuevomexicano children learned about their history and heritage in the state's schools. She earned a BA at the New Mexico Normal School in 1921, and she went on to earn another degree in Home Economics in 1927. During the 1930s, she worked as a county home demonstration agent in rural areas throughout the state. Through her experiences with nuevomexicanas in in her job with the extension service, she compiled a series of traditional recipes. In the late 1930s she began to publish cookbooks to preserve traditional nuevomexicano cooking. In the 1940s she dedicated her time to writing folktales and histories of the people in northern New Mexico. In 1954 she published her memoir, "We Fed Them Cactus," which still stands as an important primary source on the history of the early twentieth century. Fabiola Cabeza de Baca died in 1991 in Albuquerque. </p>

Under the system, a rico patron furnished an agreed upon number of sheep to a partidario for a fixed amount of time, typically three to five years. During that period, the partidario took care of the flock and worked to enhance its size. Customarily, the partidario contracted to return a set amount of lambs and wool each year, and then to return the original number of sheep to the patron at the end of the full partido period.  </p>

In New Mexico, the practice dated back to the arrival of Spanish conquistadores and it continues even today. During the nineteenth century, compadrazgo involved more than choosing godparents for a child--it was also connected to the practices of patron-client relationships and the partido system. The patrón was typically given the honor of becoming padrino to the children of those indebted to him; in return, he promised to provide for the spiritual and material needs of the child and his or her family. When Anglos increasingly took control of partidario relationships in the early twentieth century, the element of compadrazgo was neglected. </p>

The battle devastated Villa's forces and continued to erode his former reputation for invincibility. Additionally, because President Woodrow Wilson had authorized the carrancistas' use of the Southern Pacific Railroad to move troops and supplies to Agua Prieta, Villa considered the battle evidence of U.S. betrayal of his trust. Following the battle, he openly called for the murder of Americans in Mexico. Just a few months later, on March 9, 1916, he led the infamous raid on Columbus, New Mexico. </p>

Once the falsified election was over, Madero fled to San Antonio, Texas, where he and his supporters issued the Plan de San Luis Potosí--a call for a revolution to begin on November 20, 1910. Following Díaz's self-imposed exile on the heels of several revolutionary victories on the battlefield, Madero was democratically elected as Mexico's President. With the support of the U.S. Ambassador, General Victoriano Huerta led a coup against Madero's government in February 1913. Once the coup succeeded, Huerta ordered the assassination of Madero and his vice president, José María Pino Suárez. As a result of Huerta’s usurpation of power, Mexico once again devolved into civil war. </p>

He was enthralled with the people of Taos Pueblo, and their economic and political situation inspired him to advocate for Native American self-determination.
