		<h1 class = "codetitle" id = "1.0">1.0 Responsible Conduct of Behavior Analysts</h1>
		<p>Behavior analysts maintain the high standards of behavior of the profession.</p>

		<h3 id = "1.01">1.01 Reliance on Scientific Knowledge.</h3>
		<p>Behavior analysts rely on professionally derived knowledge based on science and behavior analysis when making scientific or professional judgments in human service provision, or when engaging in scholarly or professional endeavors.</p>

		<h3 id = "1.02">1.02 Boundaries of Competence.</h3>
		<p>(a) All behavior analysts provide services, teach, and conduct research only within the boundaries of their
competence, defined as being commensurate with their education, training, and supervised experience.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts provide services, teach, or conduct research in new areas (e.g., populations,

consultation from persons who are competent in those areas.</p>

<h3 id = "1.03">1.03 Maintaining Competence through Professional Development.</h3>
		<p>Behavior analysts maintain knowledge of current scientific and professional information in their areas
of practice and undertake ongoing efforts to maintain competence in the skills they use by reading the
appropriate literature, attending conferences and conventions, participating in workshops, obtaining
additional coursework, and/or obtaining and maintaining appropriate professional credentials.</p>

		<p>(a) Behavior analysts provide behavior-analytic services only in the context of a defined, professional,
or scientific relationship or role.</p>
<p>(b) When behavior analysts provide behavior-analytic services, they use language that is fully
understandable to the recipient of those services while remaining conceptually systematic with
the profession of behavior analysis. They provide appropriate information prior to service delivery
about the nature of such services and appropriate information later about results and conclusions.</p>
<p>(c) Where differences of age, gender, race, culture, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual
orientation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status significantly affect behavior analysts' work
concerning particular individuals or groups, behavior analysts obtain the training, experience,
consultation, and/or supervision necessary to ensure the competence of their services, or they make
appropriate referrals.</p>
<p>(d) In their work-related activities, behavior analysts do not engage in discrimination against
individuals or groups based on age, gender, race, culture, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual
orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or any basis proscribed by law.</p>

<p>(f) Behavior analysts recognize that their personal problems and conflicts may interfere with their
effectiveness. Behavior analysts refrain from providing services when their personal circumstances
may compromise delivering services to the best of their abilities.</p>

<h3 id = "1.06">1.06 Multiple Relationships and Conflicts of Interest.</h3>
		<p>(a) Due to the potentially harmful effects of multiple relationships, behavior analysts avoid multiple
relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts must always be sensitive to the potentially harmful effects of multiple
relationships. If behavior analysts find that, due to unforeseen factors, a multiple relationship has
arisen, they seek to resolve it.</p>
<p>(c) Behavior analysts recognize and inform clients and supervisees about the potential harmful effects
of multiple relationships.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts do not accept any gifts from or give any gifts to clients because this constitutes a
multiple relationship.</p>

<h3 id = "1.07">1.07 Exploitative Relationships.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts do not exploit persons over whom they have supervisory, evaluative, or other
authority such as students, supervisees, employees, research participants, and clients. </p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts do not engage in sexual relationships with clients, students, or supervisees,
because such relationships easily impair judgment or become exploitative. </p>
<p>(c) Behavior analysts refrain from any sexual relationships with clients, students, or supervisees, for at
least two years after the date the professional relationship has formally ended.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts do not barter for services, unless a written agreement is in place for the barter that
is (1) requested by the client or supervisee; (2) customary to the area where services are provided;
and (3) fair and commensurate with the value of behavior-analytic services provided.</p>

<h1 class = "codetitle" id = "2.0">2.0 Behavior Analysts' Responsibility to Clients.</h1>
<p>Behavior analysts have a responsibility to operate in the best interest of clients. The term client as used
here is broadly applicable to whomever behavior analysts provide services, whether an individual
person (service recipient), a parent or guardian of a service recipient, an organizational representative, a
public or private organization, a firm, or a corporation.</p>

<h3 id = "2.01">2.01 Accepting Clients.</h3>
		<p>Behavior analysts accept as clients only those individuals or entities whose requested services are
commensurate with the behavior analysts' education, training, experience, available resources,
and organizational policies. In lieu of these conditions, behavior analysts must function under the
supervision of or in consultation with a behavior analyst whose credentials permit performing such
services.</p>

<h3 id = "2.02">2.02 Responsibility.</h3>
		<p>Behavior analysts' responsibility is to all parties affected by behavior-analytic services. When multiple
parties are involved and could be defined as a client, a hierarchy of parties must be established and
communicated from the outset of the defined relationship. Behavior analysts identify and communicate
who the primary ultimate beneficiary of services is in any given situation and advocates for his or her
best interests.</p>

<h3 id = "2.03">2.03 Consultation.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts arrange for appropriate consultations and referrals based principally on the best
interests of their clients, with appropriate consent, and subject to other relevant considerations,
including applicable law and contractual obligations.</p>
<p>(b) When indicated and professionally appropriate, behavior analysts cooperate with other
professionals, in a manner that is consistent with the philosophical assumptions and principles of
behavior analysis, in order to effectively and appropriately serve their clients.</p>

<h3 id = "2.04">2.04 Third-Party Involvement in Services.</h3>
		<p>(a) When behavior analysts agree to provide services to a person or entity at the request of a third
party, behavior analysts clarify, to the extent feasible and at the outset of the service, the nature of
the relationship with each party and any potential conflicts. This clarification includes the role of
the behavior analyst (such as therapist, organizational consultant, or expert witness), the probable
uses of the services provided or the information obtained, and the fact that there may be limits to
confidentiality.</p>
<p>(b) If there is a foreseeable risk of behavior analysts being called upon to perform conflicting roles
because of the involvement of a third party, behavior analysts clarify the nature and direction of
their responsibilities, keep all parties appropriately informed as matters develop, and resolve the
situation in accordance with this Code.</p>
<p>(c) When providing services to a minor or individual who is a member of a protected population at the
request of a third party, behavior analysts ensure that the parent or client-surrogate of the ultimate
recipient of services is informed of the nature and scope of services to be provided, as well as their
right to all service records and data.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts put the client's care above all others and, should the third party make
requirements for services that are contraindicated by the behavior analyst's recommendations,
behavior analysts are obligated to resolve such conflicts in the best interest of the client. If said
conflict cannot be resolved, that behavior analyst's services to the client may be discontinued
following appropriate transition.</p>

<h3 id = "2.05">2.05 Rights and Prerogatives of Clients.</h3>
		<p>(a) The rights of the client are paramount and behavior analysts support clients' legal rights and
prerogatives.</p>
<p>(b) Clients and supervisees must be provided, on request, an accurate and current set of the behavior
analyst's credentials.</p>

clients and relevant staff in all relevant settings. Consent for different uses must be obtained
specifically and separately. </p>
<p>(d) Clients and supervisees must be informed of their rights and about procedures to lodge complaints
about professional practices of behavior analysts with the employer, appropriate authorities, and the
BACB.</p>
<p>(e) Behavior analysts comply with any requirements for criminal background checks.</p>

<h3 id = "2.06">2.06 Maintaining Confidentiality.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts have a primary obligation and take reasonable precautions to protect the
confidentiality of those with whom they work or consult, recognizing that confidentiality may be
established by law, organizational rules, or professional or scientific relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts discuss confidentiality at the outset of the relationship and thereafter as new
circumstances may warrant.</p>
<p>(c) In order to minimize intrusions on privacy, behavior analysts include only information germane
to the purpose for which the communication is made in written, oral, and electronic reports,
consultations, and other avenues.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts discuss confidential information obtained in clinical or consulting relationships,
or evaluative data concerning clients, students, research participants, supervisees, and employees,
only for appropriate scientific or professional purposes and only with persons clearly concerned
with such matters.</p>
<p>(e) Behavior analysts must not share or create situations likely to result in the sharing of any identifying
information (written, photographic, or video) about current clients and supervisees within social
media contexts.</p>

<h3 id = "2.07">2.07 Maintaining Records.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts maintain appropriate confidentiality in creating, storing, accessing, transferring,
and disposing of records under their control, whether these are written, automated, electronic, or in
any other medium.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts maintain and dispose of records in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,
corporate policies, and organizational policies, and in a manner that permits compliance with the
requirements of this Code.</p>

<h3 id = "2.08">2.08 Disclosures.</h3>
<p>Behavior analysts never disclose confidential information without the consent of the client, except
as mandated by law, or where permitted by law for a valid purpose, such as (1) to provide needed
professional services to the client, (2) to obtain appropriate professional consultations, (3) to protect
the client or others from harm, or (4) to obtain payment for services, in which instance disclosure is
limited to the minimum that is necessary to achieve the purpose. Behavior analysts recognize that
parameters of consent for disclosure should be acquired at the outset of any defined relationship and is
an ongoing procedure throughout the duration of the professional relationship.</p>

<h3 id = "2.09">2.09 Treatment/Intervention Efficacy</h3>
<p>(a) Clients have a right to effective treatment (i.e., based on the research literature and adapted to the
individual client). Behavior analysts always have the obligation to advocate for and educate the
client about scientifically supported, most-effective treatment procedures. Effective treatment
procedures have been validated as having both long-term and short-term benefits to clients and
society.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts have the responsibility to advocate for the appropriate amount and level of service provision and oversight required to meet the defined behavior-change program goals.</p>
<p>(c) In those instances where more than one scientifically supported treatment has been established,
additional factors may be considered in selecting interventions, including, but not limited to,
efficiency and cost-effectiveness, risks and side-effects of the interventions, client preference, and
practitioner experience and training.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts review and appraise the effects of any treatments about which they are aware that
might impact the goals of the behavior-change program, and their possible impact on the behaviorchange
program, to the extent possible.</p>

<h3 id = "2.10">2.10 Documenting Professional Work and Research.</h3>
<p>(a) Behavior analysts appropriately document their professional work in order to facilitate provision
of services later by them or by other professionals, to ensure accountability, and to meet other
requirements of organizations or the law.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts have a responsibility to create and maintain documentation in the kind of detail
and quality that would be consistent with best practices and the law.</p>

<h3 id = "2.11">2.11 Records and Data.</h3>
<p>(a) Behavior analysts create, maintain, disseminate, store, retain, and dispose of records and data
relating to their research, practice, and other work in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,
and policies; in a manner that permits compliance with the requirements of this Code; and in a
manner that allows for appropriate transition of service oversight at any moment in time.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts must retain records and data for at least seven (7) years and as otherwise required
by law.</p>

<h3 id = "2.12">2.12 Contracts, Fees, and Financial Arrangements.</h3>
<p>(a) Prior to the implementation of services, behavior analysts ensure that there is in place a signed
contract outlining the responsibilities of all parties, the scope of behavior-analytic services to be
provided, and behavior analysts' obligations under this Code.</p>
<p>(b) As early as is feasible in a professional or scientific relationship, behavior analysts reach an
agreement with their clients specifying compensation and billing arrangements.</p>
<p>(c) Behavior analysts' fee practices are consistent with law and behavior analysts do not misrepresent
their fees. If limitations to services can be anticipated because of limitations in funding, this is
discussed with the client as early as is feasible.</p>
<p>(d) When funding circumstances change, the financial responsibilities and limits must be revisited with
the client.</p>

<h3 id = "2.13">2.13 Accuracy in Billing Reports.</h3>
<p>Behavior analysts accurately state the nature of the services provided, the fees or charges, the identity of
the provider, relevant outcomes, and other required descriptive data.</p>

<h3 id = "2.14">2.14 Referrals and Fees.</h3>
<p>Behavior analysts must not receive or provide money, gifts, or other enticements for any professional
referrals. Referrals should include multiple options and be made based on objective determination
of the client need and subsequent alignment with the repertoire of the referee. When providing or
receiving a referral, the extent of any relationship between the two parties is disclosed to the client.</p>

<h3 id = "2.15">2.15 Interrupting or Discontinuing Services.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts act in the best interests of the client and supervisee to avoid interruption or
disruption of service.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts make reasonable and timely efforts for facilitating the continuation of behavioranalytic
services in the event of unplanned interruptions (e.g., due to illness, impairment,
unavailability, relocation, disruption of funding, disaster).</p>
<p>(c) When entering into employment or contractual relationships, behavior analysts provide for orderly
and appropriate resolution of responsibility for services in the event that the employment or
contractual relationship ends, with paramount consideration given to the welfare of the ultimate
beneficiary of services.</p>
<p>(d) Discontinuation only occurs after efforts to transition have been made. Behavior analysts
discontinue a professional relationship in a timely manner when the client: (1) no longer needs the
service, (2) is not benefiting from the service, (3) is being harmed by continued service, or (4) when
the client requests discontinuation. (See also, 4.11 Discontinuing Behavior-Change Programs and
Behavior-Analytic Services)</p>
<p>(e) Behavior analysts do not abandon clients and supervisees. Prior to discontinuation, for whatever
reason, behavior analysts: discuss service needs, provide appropriate pre-termination services,
suggest alternative service providers as appropriate, and, upon consent, take other reasonable steps
to facilitate timely transfer of responsibility to another provider.</p>

<h1 class = "codetitle" id = "3.0">3.0 Assessing Behavior.</h1>
<p>Behavior analysts using behavior-analytic assessment techniques do so for purposes that are
appropriate given current research.</p>

<h3 id = "3.01">3.01 Behavior-Analytic Assessment.</h3>
		<p>(a) Behavior analysts conduct current assessments prior to making recommendations or developing
behavior-change programs. The type of assessment used is determined by client's needs and consent,
environmental parameters, and other contextual variables. When behavior analysts are developing a
behavior-reduction program, they must first conduct a functional assessment.</p>
<p>(b) Behavior analysts have an obligation to collect and graphically display data, using behavior-analytic
conventions, in a manner that allows for decisions and recommendations for behavior-change
program development.</p>

<h3 id = "3.02">3.02 Medical Consultation.</h3>

		<p>Behavior analysts must obtain the client's written approval of the behavior-change program before
implementation or making significant modifications (e.g., change in goals, use of new procedures).</p>

<h3 id = "4.05">4.05 Describing Behavior-Change Program Objectives.</h3>
		<p>Behavior analysts describe, in writing, the objectives of the behavior-change program to the client
before attempting to implement the program. To the extent possible, a risk-benefit analysis should be
conducted on the procedures to be implemented to reach the objective. The description of program
objectives and the means by which they will be accomplished is an ongoing process throughout the
duration of the client-practitioner relationship.</p>

<h3 id = "4.06">4.06 Describing Conditions for Behavior-Change Program Success.</h3>

analysts recommend that other professional assistance (e.g., assessment, consultation or therapeutic
intervention by other professionals) be sought.</p>
<p>(b) If environmental conditions hinder implementation of the behavior-change program, behavior
analysts seek to eliminate the environmental constraints, or identify in writing the obstacles to

steps have been taken to implement reinforcement-based procedures unless the severity or
dangerousness of the behavior necessitates immediate use of aversive procedures.</p>
<p>(d) Behavior analysts ensure that aversive procedures are accompanied by an increased level of training,
supervision, and oversight. Behavior analysts must evaluate the effectiveness of aversive procedures
in a timely manner and modify the behavior-change program if it is ineffective. Behavior analysts
always include a plan to discontinue the use of aversive procedures when no longer needed.</p>

<h3 id = "4.09">4.09 Least Restrictive Procedures.</h3>

<p>(a) A violation of this Code, or disciplinary investigation, action or sanction, filing of charges, conviction
or plea of guilty or nolo contendre by a governmental agency, health care organization, third-party
payer or educational institution. Procedural note: Behavior analysts convicted of a felony directly
related to behavior analysis practice and/or public health and safety shall be ineligible to apply for BACB registration, certification, or recertification for a period of three (3) years from the
exhaustion of appeals, completion of parole or probation, or final release from confinement (if
any), whichever is later; (See also, 1.04d Integrity)</p>
<p>(b) Any public health- and safety-related fines or tickets where the behavior analyst is named on the
ticket;</p>
<p>(c) A physical or mental condition that would impair the behavior analysts' ability to competently

to the BACB's rights to the following:</p>
<p>(a) BACB logo, ACS logo, ACE logo, certificates, credentials and designations, including, but not
limited to, trademarks, service marks, registration marks and certification marks owned and
claimed by the BACB (this includes confusingly similar marks intended to convey BACB affiliation,
certification or registration, or misrepresentation of an educational ABA certificate status as
constituting national certification);</p>
<p>(b) BACB copyrights to original and derivative works, including, but not limited to, BACB copyrights
to standards, procedures, guidelines, codes, job task analysis, Workgroup reports, surveys; and</p>
<p>(c) BACB copyrights to all BACB-developed examination questions, item banks, examination

examination materials, regardless of how that content became known to them. Behavior analysts
report suspected or known infringements and/or unauthorized access to examination content
and/or any other violation of BACB intellectual property rights immediately to the BACB. Efforts

BACB approved testing centers and examination administrators and proctors. Behavior analysts must
immediately report suspected cheaters and any other irregularities relating to the BACB examination
administrations to the BACB. Examination irregularities include, but are not limited to, unauthorized
access to BACB examinations or answer sheets, copying answers, permitting another to copy answers,
disrupting the conduct of an examination, falsifying information, education or credentials, and
providing and/or receiving unauthorized or illegal advice about or access to BACB examination
content before, during, or following the examination. This prohibition includes, but is not limited
to, use of or participation in any “exam dump” preparation site or blog that provides unauthorized access to BACB examination questions. If, at any time, it is discovered that an applicant or certificant
has participated in or utilized an exam dump organization, immediate action may be taken to
withdraw eligibility, cancel examination scores, or otherwise revoke certification gained through use of
inappropriately obtained examination content.</p>

<p>Behavior analysts have an obligation to be familiar with this Code, other applicable ethics codes,
including, but not limited to, licensure requirements for ethical conduct, and their application to
behavior analysts' work. Lack of awareness or misunderstanding of a conduct standard is not itself a
defense to a charge of unethical conduct.</p>

<h3 id = "10.07">10.07 Discouraging Misrepresentation by Non-Certified Individuals.</h3>
<p>Behavior analysts report non-certified (and, if applicable, non-registered) practitioners to the
