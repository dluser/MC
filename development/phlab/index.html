		<p>The pH of a solution is a measurement of how acidic the solution is. One way to measure pH is to use pH paper. When pH paper is dipped into a solution, 
		its color changes. This color can be compared to a color key on which the different colors indicate degrees of acidity. The pH color key on which the different colors indicate degrees of acidity. 
		The pH color key also assigns a numeric value to the pH of a solution. The range of pH values is from 0 to 14. A solution that is acidic has a pH below 7. A solution that is neutral has a pH of 7. A solution
		that is basic has a pH above 7.<br><br>
		In this Virtual Lab you will use pH paper to determine the pH of common solutions. By first predicting and then testing the pH of various solutions, you will decide whether the solutions are acidic, neutral, or basic.<br>
		</p>
		<p><b>Objectives</b></p>
		<p>- Predict the pH value of common solutions.</p>
		<p>- Use pH paper to determine the pH value of common solutions.</p>
		<p>- Determine whether a common solution is acidic, netural, or basic.</p>
