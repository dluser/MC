							  <div class="content">
							    <p><strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Safari</strong> usually work well. Updating to the latest version is a good policy. Internet Explorer/Edge can be problematic. Always have more than one updated browser, and in case of trouble, try an alternate browser first.</p>

							  <div class="content">
							    <p>A <strong>basic troubleshooting technique</strong> if something goes wrong or appears wrong is <strong>to clear your browser’s cache</strong>. While still in your browser, do one of these:</p>
							    <p>On a <strong>PC</strong>: click the <strong>Control</strong>, <strong>Shift</strong>, and <strong>Delete</strong> keys together. Accept the defaults. Select “Clear Browsing Data” or whatever similar text appears.</p>
							    <p>On a <strong>Mac</strong>: click <strong>Command</strong>, <strong>Shift</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong> keys together. Accept the defaults. Select “Clear Browsing Data” or whatever similar text appears.

							    What’s best for grading? Desktop, laptop, tablet, phone?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							  	<p>The “gold standard” is to use a <strong>desktop or laptop</strong>, with a standard browser (but never Internet Explorer or Edge.) This will give the best experience. You may also use a browser to access Blackboard on your tablet or phone, which may be helpful for grading discussion postings, etc.</p>
								<p>In Safari on an iPad, you may have success navigating by using the Screen Reader Mode, available by clicking the down-arrow just to the right of the words Grade Center: Full Grade Center.</p>
								<p>Another option is the Blackboard Grader app on an iPad 2 or higher. It is not as powerful as a desktop/laptop browser but may be more accessible than a standard browser on a small device.</p>

							    What’s the difference between Grade Center and My Grades?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p><strong>Grade Center</strong> is the instructor’s tool for recording and calculating grades. Full Grade Center shows all students and all columns except those hidden from the Instructor’s view.</p>
							    <p><strong>My Grades</strong> is the students’ tool to see their grades on Blackboard. Do not delete the menu link to this tool.</p>

							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    What does My Grades look like to students?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>Instructors should periodically use the <strong>Student Preview</strong> mode to see how their course’s grades appear to students. This will reveal any duplicated columns, unused columns, etc. that should be removed to prevent confusion.</p>
							    <p>Any <strong>feedback comments</strong> you leave in the <strong>Feedback to Learner</strong> textbox will be indicated by a “speech bubble” icon.</p>
							    <p>Rubrics linked to a grade will produce a <strong>View Rubric</strong> link if students are allowed to see the rubric.</p>
							    <p>Clicking on the <strong>name of a test</strong>, <strong>and in the next window on the numerals of the test grade</strong> will show all feedback allowed for tests.</p>
							    <p>Clicking on the name of an assignment will show the submitted/graded assignment to the student.</p>

							    Hidden Columns: I hid columns but students still see them, or, I want them back, or, Students report columns that I don’t see. What do I do now?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>In the drop-down menu for any column, there are two “hide” options. One is a toggle, <strong>“Hide from Students (on/off).”</strong> Hide from Students may also be set in the options for a graded assignment or test. The other is <strong>“Hide from Instructor view.”</strong></p>
							    <p>Grade center items hidden from students are marked with a gray circle with a red slash before the column’s name.</p>
							    <p>Grade center items <strong>hidden from instructors</strong> are not visible in the normal grade center views. To see, and if desired un-hide them, use <strong>Manage > Column Organization</strong>. The Manage button is a large icon above the main grade center spreadsheet. Hidden columns will be light gray and in italics</p>
							    <p>To <strong>reveal</strong> a hidden column, select its left-margin checkbox. Use the tool button (located above and below the spreadsheet) <strong>“Show/Hide” > Show Selected Columns</strong>. Then <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

							    Can I re-order columns in my Grade Center?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>In Full Grade Center, choose <strong>Manage > Column Organization</strong>. There, all your columns will appear in one window. Use the four-pointed-arrow in the left margin to slide columns up or down the list, as you wish. Items at the top will be at the far left of your grade center spreadsheet.</p>

							    Can I sort values in Grade Center columns?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>Clicking the <strong>header</strong> on each grade center column will sort it. Click again, and it will reverse-sort. This is useful to find students who have not completed an assignment, for example: sort the column to bring all blank or 0 values to the top of the list.</p>
							    <p>To re-establish an alphabetical list by student, click the student name or username column header.</p>

The only values you must enter are the <strong>Column Name</strong>, and the <strong>Points Possible</strong> for the item.

							    Duplicated or unnecessary columns—what do I do?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>It’s a best practice to <strong>delete duplicated or unused/unnecessary grade center columns.</strong>In the column’s action menu, click on Delete.</p>
							    <p><strong>Safeguards:</strong> You <strong>cannot delete columns</strong> that are attached to work assigned and to be graded in Blackboard, such as assignments, tests, graded Discussions, etc. Caveat: any hand-entry or calculated column can be deleted, even if it contains grades.</p>
							    <p>Sometimes the copy process adds additional Weighted Total and Total columns. Don’t just hide them: delete them.</p>

							    The Green Checkmark—what is it? How do I get rid of it?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>A <strong>grade column headed with a green checkmark cannot be deleted</strong> because it has been declared as the External Grade. This setting has no current function at CNM. If you wish to delete the column, <strong>set any other column</strong> as External Grade by using its column menu. Once the green checkmark is moved from a column, the column may be deleted (unless it is attached to work assigned and graded in Blackboard.)</p>

							  <div class="title">
							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    I have column(s) that I can’t delete. What do I do?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>First look for the <strong>Green Checkmark</strong> and see that answer in this FAQ. Next, diligently search for the assignment/test/etc. that may be attached to a column. Delete the graded work and the column will disappear, or will now allow you to delete it. It’s a best practice not to “store” unused assignments or tests in a Blackboard course. Save materials that you might use in the future in appropriate files on your own computer.</p>

							    <p>In that window are several tabs: Attempts, Manual Override, Column Details, and Grade History. Click <strong>Grade History</strong>, which will show the last 2-3 actions.

							    Can Blackboard calculate course grades for me?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>Yes! Blackboard’s default calculated column is a <strong>Total Column</strong> of all points for all grade columns. This can be expressed as a point total, or as a percentage of possible points. For the percentage display, the possible points may be all course points, or all points for work graded so far. </p>
							    <p>An <strong>Average Column</strong> takes all grades as percentages and averages them, equally weighted. </p>
							    <p>A <strong>Weighted Column</strong> allows Bb to calculate typical course grades such as “Quizzes 30%, Homework 35%, Midterm 15%, Final Exam 20%.” This is a very powerful tool, but we recommend consultation with the DL staff when you first set this up, as there are many potential pitfalls.</p>
							    <p>For special purposes, there is a <strong>Minimum/Maximum </strong>Column tool; again, please ask for DL assistance in these cases.</p>

							  <div class="title">
							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    Can Blackboard drop grades?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>When using a calculated Weighted Column, you may have Bb <strong>drop one or more grades</strong> in any category you are using. Please contact DL for assistance when you first set this up.</p>
							  </div>

							  <div class="title">
							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    Can I add an extra credit column?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>If you base your course grade on total points earned, this is simple to do. Use Create Column, name it Extra Credit (or something else appropriate) and make it <strong>worth 0 (zero) points</strong>. Bb will allow you to give values greater than that, so the column truly is <strong>extra</strong> credit. For assistance, or for other situations than a simple Total column, please contact DL for assistance.</p>

							  <div class="title">
							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    What is “Calculate as Running Total” in my Total (or other calculated column)?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>The default setting here, <strong>“Yes”, requires you to input grades of 0 (zero)</strong> for any <strong>missed</strong> work. Otherwise Bb will ignore that column in calculating a student’s grade.</p>
							    <p>The alternate setting, <strong>“No”</strong>, automatically considers <strong>all grades to be 0 (zero)</strong> until/unless another grade is entered by students completing work or instructors hand-entering grades.</p>

							    I saw various colors in someone’s grade center. How do I do that?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    In Full Grade Center, click <strong>Manage > Grading Color Codes</strong>. There you may set colors for grading status or grade range criteria. These colors are only seen the instructor, in his/her instructor view of the Grade Center.

							    In the Edit Column Information > Primary Display, I see “Letter” and “Text.” What’s the difference?
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>Setting <strong>“Text”</strong> allows you to enter letter grades or words into the grade cell.</p>
							    <p>Setting <strong>“Letter”</strong> allows Bb to convert students’ grades to a letter value. The default Letter is not useful at CNM, as it includes + and – grades. This can be edited from <strong>Manage > Grading Schemas</strong>. Please ask DL for assistance if you wish to use this tool.</p>
							  </div>

							  <div class="title">
							    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
							    How can I have Blackboard assign letter grades? 
							  </div>
							  <div class="content">
							    <p>First, use <strong>Manage > Grading Schemas</strong> and create or edit a scheme to match your course’s grade structure. Remember to consider rounding—must students earn 90% for an A, or should 89.5% be rounded to an A? Also, make the category for A include values up to about 110%, in case you decide to use extra credit.</p>
							    <p>Next, in an appropriate column, set the primary display to this edited grading schema and submit. Grades in that column should be showing now as appropriate letter values.</p>
