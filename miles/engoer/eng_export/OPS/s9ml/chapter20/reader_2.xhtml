But in doing so, a critical examination is often lost in a barrage of name-calling and hyperbole. To try to understand the other side of an argument, consider writing an issue dialogue, starting with the most extreme positions and moving toward more reasonable compromises. One example, for instance, is the debate that surrounds whether universities should continue to raise tuition in order to make up for government cutbacks to education:</p>

                <br/>
                <b>Against:</b> Not true. Education is an investment. What some people don’t realize is that when a student eventually receives a better job because of his education, he will pay more in taxes. This increased revenue will more than repay the government for what it spent on his education.<br/>
                <br/>
                <i><b>For:</b> That’s assuming that a student will find a better job because of his education; many people, like Bill Gates, have done well without a degree. And even if you can prove that students will make more money, that doesn’t mean that they will remain in the community that invested in their education.</i><br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Against:</b> True, but most probably will, and anyway, the university invests a lot of its money in these surrounding communities. As for your second point, for every Bill Gates, there are thousands of college dropouts who are flipping burgers or living on the streets.<br/>
                <br/>
                <i><b>For:</b> But why should someone who doesn’t have children or live near a university town have to support an institution that doesn’t give anything back to them? Would you want to have to spend your hard earned money to support a senior center’s golf course?</i><br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Against:</b> Studies have shown that when governments do not spend money on education, they have to spend more on prisons so it’s not as though cutting funding for education will benefit those taxpayers you describe. However, I agree that certain families should pay more for their children’s education, as long as they can afford it.<br/>
                <br/>
                <i><b>For:</b> And I will concede that governments should continue to provide access to education for those who can’t afford it, but I think even children of poor families have an obligation to give back to the community that supported them when they finish their degrees.</i><br/>

Again, when writing an issue dialogue, it is tempting to ridicule those on the other side with stock phrases to make it easier to dismiss their views (especially when looking at perspectives from different cultures and eras). But the more you can reasonably state the opposing view’s arguments, the more you can reasonably state your own, and, in terms of analysis and argument, everyone should apply the same amount of scrutiny to their own beliefs as they do to those who disagree with them.</p>

In addition, you should consider the strength of the arguments, evaluating how well the author supports the main assertions with sound evidence and reasoning while paying particular attention to whether they rely on any fallacies—errors in reasoning. For instance, does the author make any hasty generalizations? Consider someone who attempts to argue that global warming doesn’t exist on the basis that the weather has been quite cold for the last few days. Obviously the person would make a stronger case for her argument by presenting more encompassing evidence. Another common fallacy is the faulty syllogism (i.e. all cats die; Socrates is dead; therefore Socrates was a cat). Just because two items under considerations have a certain quality in common, does not mean that these items are the same. Perhaps the most common fallacy that students make is “guilt by association.” This may be due to the fact that politicians use it all the time. </p>

John McCain’s significant personal wealth was seen as evidence that he would be insensitive to the needs of the poor, even though liberals like Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy were wealthy. Also, be aware of the opposite fallacy—success by association. Go to any tennis shoe commercial on YouTube and you will see famous athletes performing incredible acts, as though the shoes, and not years of practice, are responsible for their success.

Though there are many different types of tropes (words or phrases that point toward a figurative meaning)—such as metaphor, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c685d179c9574882b7be4686348662bc"><dfn title="c685d179c9574882b7be4686348662bc">simile</dfn></a>, and synecdoche, the basic function of each is to allow someone to literally “see what you mean” by comparing an abstract concept to something concrete. One reason the metaphor “love is a rose” is so well known is that the object and the concept match extremely well. A rose, like love, may manifest in many different forms and have several complex layers when examined closely. Roses show the cheerful side of love because they look nice, smell sweet, and inspire warm fuzzy feelings. </p>

Like the different people you love, a rose requires just the right amount of attention and care—neither too much nor too little.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-f26b35c9d410476abc35acc317675c82" data-uuid="f26b35c9d410476abc35acc317675c82">The need to extend metaphorical implications is especially apparent when analyzing a poem or a song. For instance, in her song “China,” Tori Amos explores the different metaphorical significance the central term has on a crumbling relationship: a far away location that represents the distance couples often feel between each other, a place with a Great Wall that can refer to the figurative barriers we build to protect ourselves emotionally, and fancy plates that, on closer examination, have cracks (just like those who seem to have the perfect relationship and then suddenly announce that they are breaking up). Tori Amos, “China,” <i>Little Earthquakes</i> (Atlantic Records, 1992). In this case, understanding the metaphorical significance can give the audience an even greater appreciation of the song. When we say that a song (or any piece of art) “strikes a chord,” we mean that it resonates with our thoughts, feelings, and memories, and an understanding of its central metaphors allows us to relate to it in even more ways.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-5e7549885d94473b9c70968b410accd9" data-uuid="5e7549885d94473b9c70968b410accd9">Metaphorical language does not come up only in the arts, but also in other disciplines, especially theology and philosophy. Nearly all religious texts are filled with parables and analogies because they provide us with concrete images to explain spiritual concepts. Perhaps the most famous analogy from antiquity is Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave,” in which Socrates compares human understanding to people locked in chains and forced to look at the shadows of themselves, cast by the light of candles against a cave wall.</p>
            <figure id="data-uuid-2a909c8628f948aa948d7ed24f2e113c" data-uuid="2a909c8628f948aa948d7ed24f2e113c" class="figure-image">

When one brave soul (read Socrates) escapes these confines and leaves the cave to discover the true reality, he returns to the people left behind to tell them of their limited existence. Instead of being grateful, they choose not to believe him and have him put to death because they prefer to accept the reality to which they’ve become accustomed.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-f1bba1da333c483491e668e24e9ad385" data-uuid="f1bba1da333c483491e668e24e9ad385">While this analogy continues to be told in various forms, it still needs to be examined critically. For instance, you might ask who put them in the cave and why? Is our reality set up as a training ground to move on to more satisfying forms of existence, as proposed in the film <i>The Matrix</i>? Or is it a cruel joke in which we’re allowed only a glimpse of a set reality while wallowing in our own inability to effect change? In addition, many have argued that the analogy relies on a transcendent notion of Truth that cannot be communicated or realized—that Socrates believes that there is a greater place outside of our natural existence only because he has a vivid imagination or a need to prove his own importance. If this is true, then we might do better to improve the existence we actually experience than to stagnate while hoping for a better one.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-7625d084f917486899089a245e2fcf7a" dir="ltr" data-uuid="7625d084f917486899089a245e2fcf7a">But while poets, philosophers, and songwriters use metaphorical language to entertain and enlighten, many others use it primarily to manipulate—drawing off of the symbolic value of certain terms. Again, advertisers are masters of this manipulation, helping companies to embed their products with metaphorical significance, beginning with what they choose to call them. Car companies often use the names of swift predatory animals to associate their products with speed, control, and power. And advertisers love to use analogies because they don’t have to be proven. For example, when stating that a product works “like magic,” advertisers benefit from all the associations with a mystical process that offers quick, painless solutions without having to demonstrate its actual effectiveness. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-c1a691e03fe44f678a7cab2d710dbc71" dir="ltr" data-uuid="c1a691e03fe44f678a7cab2d710dbc71">Be particularly on guard for inappropriate analogies when analyzing arguments. For instance, people may attempt to justify violent acts to advance their version of the public good by using the analogy that “you have to break a few eggs to make a cake.” A person is far more valuable than an egg, and the analogy is simply inappropriate. The analogy would be far more appropriate and effective if used to justify how you might need to give up smoking or sleeping late in order to get back into shape.</p>

For instance, the politician who stands in front of a flag while giving a speech is attempting to feed off of the patriotic implications associated with it. Likewise, fast food companies often use images of clowns and cartoon figures to associate their products with the carefree days of childhood when we didn’t have to worry about gaining weight or having high cholesterol. But images we see in painting, sculpture, photography, and the other arts offer more subtle and variant interpretations and deserve more careful examination.</p>

This is especially true of Van Gogh’s “The Starry Night.” In his song “Vincent,” singer-songwriter Don McLean describes the painting as “swirling clouds in violet haze” that reflect the eyes of an artist who suffered for his sanity because the people around him could not understand or appreciate his vision.

                Music can also create feelings of triumph, joy, or despair without the need for any words to convey a direct message. Again, sometimes this invoking of emotion can happen in a way that seems apparent and universal, (such as how the theme song from the film Star Wars evokes feelings of heroism, excitement, and adventure) or in ways that are more subtle and complex. Jerry Farber, Professor of Comparative Literature, explains that the aesthetic appeal of Mozart’s <i>Violin Concerto in A Major</i> emerges through the contrast among the various musical themes within it:</p>

Particularly during one section, a so-called ‘Turkish’ episode in a different time signature and a minor key, the listener is likely, once having adjusted to this new and exotic atmosphere, to be swept far away from the courtly minuet. Still, the overall structure is the context in which we hear this episode and is likely, if only by effect of contrast, to help shape our resonant response (Farber, Jerry.  <i>A Field Guide to the Aesthetic Experience</i>. New York: Forwards, 1982. 106).</p>

For instance, in analyzing both a poem and a song, you can consider the major metaphors, key terms, and actions. But with a song, you should also consider how it’s sung, which instruments are used, and how the music underscores or contrasts with the lyrics. Likewise, an analysis of both a painting and a film requires attention to the color, composition, and perspective of the scene. But with a film, you should also consider the dialogue, background music, and how each scene relates to the ones that come before and after it. Keep in mind that although different kinds of texts tend to stimulate particular types of responses, sometimes it is fruitful to think about pieces in light of seemingly incongruous perspectives. For instance, you could look at a love song as reflecting cultural attitudes about gender roles or a political speech as encouraging psychological disorders such as paranoia. </p>

In fact, taste and smell can play a crucial role in our experiences, as they have the strongest connection to memory. However, be sure to consult not only your writing prompt but also your teacher to determine if a first person subjective response is what your teacher is looking for. In <i>Swann’s Way</i>, the first part of his prolific novel <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, French author Marcel Proust describes how dipping a pastry in tea helped him to recall a period of his life that he might have otherwise permanently forgotten. Though at first he couldn’t recall why the taste had such a powerful effect on him, he eventually remembered that it was something his grandmother gave him as a child when the family visited her in the summer. The taste helped him to recall not only his moments with his grandmother but the details of the house and town itself. As he puts it:</p>

Marcel Proust, <i>Swann’s Way</i>, trans. C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Killmartin (New York: Random House, 1981), 50–51.</p>

When doing so, take a step back and try to look at yourself as you might a character in a novel. Detaching yourself like this can be hard to do, especially when you have a vested interest in seeing yourself in a certain light. However, you often obtain your best insights when you try, to paraphrase the poet Robert Burns, to see yourself as others see you. The example below illustrates how a student can both present and analyze an experience.</p>
            <section id="data-uuid-6e81d50b1954475eab9d6aa6056b4497" data-uuid="6e81d50b1954475eab9d6aa6056b4497" class="section section-a">

                    <br/>
                    I take a bitter sip from the rusty drinking fountain and head to the weight room where I see a young man completing his set on the first machine. He is definitely impressed with himself, periodically looking in the mirror with an expression that would make Narcissus ashamed. When he gets off, I wait until he turns around so he can see me move the key down to include more weight than he was just using. The satisfaction I get from this action comes partly from deflating some of his ego and partly from inflating my own. However, my own smugness is short-lived, because as soon as I get up, a much older man with a noticeable beer belly and smelling of Ben Gay sits at the machine and lowers the key much further than where I had it.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I go through my weight routine with a bit more humility and then wander over to the elliptical for the aerobic portion of my workout. I pull out my iPod and click to Credence Clearwater Revival, the only group with a happy enough sound to take my mind off my aching feet. After enough time, I leave the same way via the guy at the front desk (only now I return his, “Bye Randy,” with a generic and slightly over enthusiastic, “See you later; have a good day”).<br/>

You could discuss why you find it embarrassing to admit any personal weakness, whether it stems from my a memory for trying to recall names or from an inability to lift as much weight as others. You could discuss the key in the weight machine metaphorically, and how the experience warped your mind and encouraged you to see a simple tool as a larger symbol of competition. You could also discuss the effect of music and how it takes the sting out of exercise by allowing you to focus on something other than the painful routine that stretches out before you. Finally, you could discuss how the rusty taste of the drinking fountain water or the smell of Ben Gay and sweat will always remind you of this particular gym.</p>

Whereas a relationship with another person is the sum total of all the time you’ve already spent with that person, making a decision involves imagining what might come about as a result of our choices. </p>

For instance, if I were to analyze whether I should adopt a kitten, my mind may race through a string of potentially good and bad memories of having had cats in the past: images of soft, cuddly, purring little creatures that also like to destroy drapes and meow in my ear at five in the morning. Of course, no matter how long and hard we think about something, we can never be sure that the outcome will work out for us in the way we hope and expect. Still, to be satisfied that we at least tried to make an informed, intelligent, and aware decision, we must slow down and reconsider all the relevant moments that we’ve already experienced; this is one of the most important steps in the analysis process.</p>
