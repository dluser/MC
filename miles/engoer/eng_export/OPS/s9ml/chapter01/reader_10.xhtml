Some students mistakenly think that longer words and more complicated sentence structures make their writing "better" or make it sound more sophisticated. In reality, however, the longer and more complicated a sentence gets, the harder it is for a reader to interpret that sentence, and the harder it is to keep them engaged with your argument. For example, if you find yourself using a phrase like "due to the fact that," you can simplify your wording and make your sentence more powerful by saying "because" instead. Similarly, say "now" or "currently" rather than "at this point in time." Unnecessarily complicated wording distracts your reader from your argument; simpler sentence structures let your ideas shine through.</p>

In order to successfully break that rule, the chef first had to understand all the flavors at work in both ingredients, and make the choice knowing that it would improve the recipe. It's only a good idea to break these rules and principles if there is a specific, good reason to do so. Therefore, if you plan to dispense with one of these conventions, it is a good idea to make sure your instructor approves of your stylistic choice.</p>

However, there's no need to feel like it's a sign of your lack of ability; on the contrary, many of the strongest student writers regularly seek help and support with their writing (that's why they're so strong). College instructors are familiar with the ups and downs of writing, and most universities have support systems in place to help students learn how to write for an academic audience.

Most instructors will be happy to meet with you during office hours to discuss guidelines for writing about their particular discipline. If you have any doubts about research methods, paper structure, writing style, etc., address these uncertainties with the instructor before you hand in your paper, rather than waiting to see the critiques they write in the margins afterward. If you have questions, ask them.  For example, if you’re not sure about which point of view is appropriate for a specific paper, raise your hand in class and ask your teacher.  Your peers may have a similar question, but they may be too afraid to ask.  Lastly, you are not bothering your instructor by showing up for office hours; they'll be glad to see you.</p>

Independent paper-writing workshops provide a space for peers with varying interests, work styles, and areas of expertise to brainstorm.</p>
            <p> If you want to improve your writing, organizing a workshop session with your classmates is a great strategy. You can also ask your writing center to help you organize a workshop for a specific class or subject. In high school, students submit their work in multiple stages, from the thesis statement to the outline to a draft of the paper; finally, after receiving feedback on each preliminary piece, they submit a completed project. This format teaches students how to divide writing assignments into smaller tasks and schedule these tasks over an extended period of time, instead of scrambling through the entire process right before the deadline. Some college courses build this kind of writing schedule into major assignments.
            Even if your course does not, you can master the skill of breaking large assignments down into smaller projects instead of leaving an unmanageable amount of work until the last minute.</p><p> Academic writing can, at times, feel overwhelming. You can waste a great deal of time staring at a blank screen or a troublesome paragraph, when it would be more productive to move on to drafting other parts of your paper. When you return to the problem section a few hours later (or, even better, the next day), the solution may be obvious. </p>

Drafting gets your ideas onto paper, which gives you more to work with than the perfectionist's daunting blank screen. You can always return later to fix the problems that bother you.</p>

                    "Dear," or a more informal "Hello" or "Hi." Don't

                    first and last name, the course number, and the class time. This will make it
                    easy for your professor to identify you, and although they are typically more than happy to help
