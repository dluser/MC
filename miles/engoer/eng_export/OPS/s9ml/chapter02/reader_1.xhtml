                sharpen both your reading and your writing skills. Most of your writing
                assignments—from brief response papers to in-depth research projects—will
                depend on your understanding of course reading assignments or related readings
                you do on your own. And it is difficult, if not impossible, to write
                effectively about a text that you do not understand. Even when you do
                understand the reading, it can be hard to write about it if you do not feel
                personally engaged with the ideas discussed.</p>

                    time for reading and breaking your assignments into manageable chunks. If you
                    are assigned a seventy-page chapter to read for next week’s class, try not to
                    wait until the night before to get started. Give yourself at least a few days

                assignment will depend on the type of reading. If the text is dense and packed
                with unfamiliar terms and concepts, you may need to read no more than five or
                ten pages in one sitting so that you can truly understand and process the
                information. With more user-friendly texts, you will be able to handle longer
                sections—twenty to forty pages, for instance. And if you have a highly engaging
                reading assignment, such as a novel you cannot put down, you may be able to
                read lengthy passages in one sitting.</p>

                will develop a better sense of how much time you need to allow for the reading
                assignments in different subjects. It also makes sense to preview each
                assignment well in advance to assess its difficulty level and to determine how
                much reading time to set aside.</p>

                other key component of planning is setting a purpose. Knowing what you want to
                achieve from a reading assignment not only helps you determine how to approach
                that task, but it also helps you stay focused during those occasional moments
                when you are up late, tired, or relaxing in front of the television sounds far
                more appealing than curling up with a stack of journal articles.</p>

                your purpose is simple. You might just need to understand the reading material
                well enough to discuss it intelligently in class the next day. However, your
                purpose will often go beyond that. For instance, you might also read to compare
                two texts, to formulate a personal response to a text, or to gather ideas for
                future research. Here are some questions to ask to help determine your purpose:</p>

                </b>or main point: the most important
                idea that the writer wants to communicate and often states early on. Finding
                the main point gives you a framework to organize the details presented in the
                reading and relate the reading to concepts you learned in class or through
                other reading assignments. After identifying the main point, you will find the <b><a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-fcc6f98c0c1340bfbb8e359953231529"><dfn title="fcc6f98c0c1340bfbb8e359953231529">supporting points</dfn></a></b>, the details, facts, and explanations that

                texts make that task relatively easy. Textbooks, for instance, include the
                aforementioned features as well as headings and subheadings intended to make it
                easier for students to identify core concepts. Graphic features, such as
                sidebars, diagrams, and charts, help students understand complex information
                and distinguish between essential and inessential points. When you are assigned
                to read from a textbook, be sure to use available comprehension aids to help
                you identify the main points.</p>

                books and popular articles may not be written specifically for an educational
                purpose; nevertheless, they also include features that can help you identify
                the main ideas. These features include the following:</p>
            <ul id="data-uuid-2e05d0f0c3cf46cab22a0b2d030c053b" data-uuid="2e05d0f0c3cf46cab22a0b2d030c053b">

                    presents the writer’s main ideas and purpose for writing. Reading chapter
                    titles (and any subtitles within the chapter) will help you obtain a broad
                    sense of what is covered. It also helps to read the beginning and ending
                    paragraphs of a chapter closely. These paragraphs often sum up the main ideas
                    presented.</li>

                    paragraphs carefully is crucial. In magazine articles, these features (along
                    with the closing paragraphs) present the main concepts. Hard news articles in
                    newspapers present the gist of the news story in the lead paragraph, while
                    subsequent paragraphs present increasingly general details.</li>
            </ul>

                the far end of the reading difficulty scale are scholarly books and journal
                articles. Because these texts are written for a specialized, highly educated
                audience, the authors presume their readers are already familiar with the
                topic. The language and writing style is sophisticated and sometimes dense.</p>

                you read scholarly books and journal articles, try to apply the same strategies
                discussed earlier. The introduction usually presents the writer’s thesis, the idea or hypothesis the writer is trying to prove.
                Headings and subheadings can help you understand how the writer has organized
                support for his or her thesis. Additionally, academic journal articles often
                include a summary at the beginning, called an abstract, and electronic
                databases include summaries of articles, too.</p>

                the main idea and paying attention to text features as you read helps you
                figure out what you should know. Just as important, however, is being able to
                figure out what you do not know and developing a strategy to deal with it.</p>

                often include comprehension questions in the margins or at the end of a section
                or chapter. As you read, stop occasionally to answer these questions on paper
                or in your head. Use them to identify sections you may need to reread, read
                more carefully, or ask your instructor about later.</p>

                when a text does not have built-in comprehension features, you can actively
                monitor your own comprehension. Try these strategies, adapting them as needed
                to suit different kinds of texts:</p>

                    the main points in a few sentences. If you have trouble doing so, revisit that

                    to identify two to three questions you should be able to answer after you
                    finish it. Write down your questions and use them to test yourself on the
                    reading. If you cannot answer a question, try to determine why. Is the answer
                    buried in that section of reading but just not coming across to you? Or do you
                    expect to find the answer in another part of the reading?</li>

                    reading with your classmates. Many instructors set up online discussion forums
                    or blogs specifically for that purpose. Participating in these discussions can
                    help you determine whether your understanding of the main points is the same as

                discussions can also serve as a reality check. If everyone in the class
                struggled with the reading, it may be exceptionally challenging. If it was a
                breeze for everyone but you, you may need to see your instructor for help.</p>
