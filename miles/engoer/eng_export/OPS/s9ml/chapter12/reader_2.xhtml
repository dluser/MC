Two examples of personal narratives are literacy narratives and memoirs.  These genres share more similarities than differences, so for this reason, we will cover the genres in one chapter; however, your teachers may assign either the literacy narrative or memoir, so please closely read your essay prompts. This chapter covers similarities in these two genres, and in later subsections, the chapter covers how the genres are different.</p>

Memoirs and literacy narratives can also be classified as creative nonfiction. Narratives whether in the form of a poem, a story, or an essay, often attempt to achieve, or create, an effect in the minds of the readers. In this class, you will only write nonfiction, but if you would like to learn more about creative writing, check out the creative writing courses the CNM English department offers: English 2220 (nonfiction) English 2221 (fiction), English 2222 (poetry).  Additionally, the student literary journal at CNM, Leonardo, publishes creative nonfiction, fiction, and poetry.  If you write a memoir for class that you are proud of, consider submitting your memoir essay to Leonardo, which accepts submissions in the fall and spring semesters.

The intention or purpose may be to expound on the grieving process (catharsis), or to encourage an emotional response from the reader, for example, making a person laugh or cry. The potential results are unlimited.  Creative writing can also be used as an outlet for people to get their thoughts and feelings out and onto paper. Many people enjoy creative writing but prefer not to share it. For this class, be prepared to share your narratives with your teacher and potentially classmates if your teacher uses peer review.</p>

Human strife is human strife. For this reason, the subject of the memoir cannot be you.  Your story, whether a literacy narrative or a memoir, needs to be about something larger than yourself. Your task, as the writer, is to explain how an event or experience is vexing, enlightening, or engrossing, something an outside reader could potentially relate to.  Here’s an example, I used to spend summers at my grandmother’s house in New Jersey--snore.  Who cares, right?</p>
        <p id="data-uuid-1b96595cd57b4d1c94fab0cf4d18b04a" dir="ltr" data-uuid="1b96595cd57b4d1c94fab0cf4d18b04a">But what if I explain that during my stay at my grandmother’s house in New Jersey when I was nineteen, I learn that my father has re-married without telling me and he now has a child on the way.  I understandably feel betrayed and left out.  Throughout the story, I reflect on the idea of honesty and trust in father-daughter relationships, while explaining the events that unfolded as my father called me on the phone and said I was his little Pica-paca-pu.  Now that’s a story. The more specific the details in a memoir or literacy narrative, the more human, appealing, and universal your story becomes.</p>

Chances are that you won’t remember every word you spoke or what the weather was like, but it is important that you tell the emotional truth. In other words, you convey the heart of what happened and what it meant, rather than intentionally changing aspects of the story to make it more interesting or to make yourself (or your Grandma or your third grade teacher) look better. For example, let’s say your mother’s favorite color is red and you know when you were first learning to read that she had a red dress she wore often. It’s perfectly okay to say that your mother was wearing that red dress when she sat you down to teach you the alphabet; however, it’s not okay to say that she turned into a giant dinosaur that day. Filling in small pieces with likely details from the past is fine, but outright fabricating is not.</p>

Typically, these events will be revealed chronologically and a climax at a central conflict that must be resolved by the end of the story. Major narrative events are most often conveyed in chronological order, the order in which events unfold from first to last. Stories typically have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and these events are typically organized by time. </p>

On occasion, a narrative can be structured by starting in the present and then "flashing back" to a prior, related event. Typically, this is a strategy used to create interest and tension--the reader has to read the rest of the narrative to find out what happened. When using flashback, the writer usually concludes by returning to the present and reflecting on the flashback or its resolution.  Regardless of your structure, whether you tell your story chronologically or non-chronologically,  you will definitely need transitional words and phrases to guide the reader through time. </p>

Try opening the essay with an event that is interesting to introduce the story and get it going. Tell the story with scene and engaging details. Finally, your conclusion should help resolve the central conflict of the story and impress upon your reader the ultimate theme of the piece. The ultimate theme of the piece is the larger wisdom or the universal experience that other people can relate to and enjoy.  </p>

In creative writing, summary is different--it’s a way to manage time. When you tell the reader what used to happen in your family, for example, you could explain, “My mother used to cook Sunday dinner for the family.  She often made a roast.” You are summarizing what used to happen in the past.  If you were to write about a specific Sunday, and you fleshed out what happened in scene with dialogue, included details about the sound of vegetables being chopped, described the smells in the kitchen, and told the reader what your mother was wearing, and reflected on the conversation you had, that would be a scene.  Summary condenses information in both academic and creative writing, but in creative writing, summary is linked to time management.</p>

It’s not literally you, because you are not words on the page, right? You are flesh and bone and you have a rich inner life. Use that rich inner life to develop your persona.  Persona comes from the Latin word for mask.  It’s the version of you that you would like to illustrate for the reader in your memoir. This is a complicated concept. One way to think of your persona is you in relationship to the situation or people in the story. The persona can also be shaped by time: who and what you were like when you were twelve, for example. It can be shaped by relationship to your topic: who and what you are like in relationship to your mother or third grade teacher or your sergeant in boot camp.</p>

You are accountable to telling the story to your reader as truthfully as you can, while using craft elements to engage the reader.  It’s a daunting task. Also, readers like protagonists who are flawed, so be truthful about your mistakes.  </p>

            <p id="data-uuid-bd018d76cafd4a7a94bc1d780a3f4b81" dir="ltr" data-uuid="bd018d76cafd4a7a94bc1d780a3f4b81">For our purposes and time constraints, we will define literacy as the ability to read and write.  When you combine that concept with the rhetorical mode of narration, a literacy narrative is born. In a literacy narrative, a writer may discuss learning to read and write, or the writer could recall a time in which he/she became more proficient or skilled in reading and writing, or a writer could even write about a person who taught him/her to read or be inspired by stories. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-b0e949c5b37c4b07b249fc4dfdaaa4e2" dir="ltr" data-uuid="b0e949c5b37c4b07b249fc4dfdaaa4e2">Because a literacy narrative is a story, a story needs to have some sort of trouble, or something vexing for you as the protagonist.  For that reason, literacy narratives can contain specific themes to help focus the story.  For example, literacy can be linked to the idea of being empowered, for example, Malcolm X describes the freeing aspects of literacy in his essay, “Literacy Behind Bars.”  If literacy has affected your identity or self-discovery, you could write about “...the time my journal saved my life or sanity...who knew I was a slam poet?”  You could also tackle how literacy for you is linked to struggle or triumph, for example, the story could begin, “Here I am in college. I’m sure my second grade teacher, Mrs. Lukenda, who once told me I was dumber than a box of rocks, would be surprised.”</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-63982dc8164346168ff22bf9944b470f" dir="ltr" data-uuid="63982dc8164346168ff22bf9944b470f">The more specific you are in a literacy narrative, the more focused the details become.  When you write about the time you learned to read and write, you wouldn’t want to focus on every detail of your life at the time, because it wouldn’t be useful to let the reader know that you learned to read at about the same time you visited Santa, or lost your first tooth, unless those details help you to tell your story. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-c825bea2dad0478ab86231d96f9eb703" dir="ltr" data-uuid="c825bea2dad0478ab86231d96f9eb703">Additionally, it is important to understand that there are many different types of literacy narratives. For example, you could explore a theme of empowerment through literacy; one example would be Malcolm X’s essay “Literacy Behind Bars” where he explores the freeing aspects of literacy.  Or a literacy narrative could cover becoming literate in a new culture.  Literacy can also pertain to learning a new language.  If you are unsure whether your story of literacy follows your teacher’s guidelines, set some time aside before or after class to meet with your teacher.  Or visit your teacher during his/her office hours and pitch your ideas.</p>

Our first assignment was to write a short response paper to the Albert Camus essay “The Myth of Sisyphus.” I was extremely nervous about the assignment as well as college. However, through all the confusion in philosophy class, many of my questions about life were answered.<br/>
                I entered college intending to earn a degree in engineering. I always liked the way mathematics had right and wrong answers. I understood the logic and was very good at it. So when I received my first philosophy assignment that asked me to write my interpretation of the Camus essay, I was instantly confused. What is the right way to do this assignment, I wondered? I was nervous about writing an incorrect interpretation and did not want to fail my first assignment. Even more troubling was that the professor refused to give us any guidelines on what he was looking for; he gave us total freedom. He simply said, “I want to see what you come up with.”<br/>
                Full of anxiety, I first set out to read Camus’s essay several times to make sure I really knew what was it was about. I did my best to take careful notes. Yet even after I took all these notes and knew the essay inside and out, I still did not know the right answer. What was my interpretation? I could think of a million different ways to interpret the essay, but which one was my professor looking for? In math class, I was used to examples and explanations of solutions. This assignment gave me nothing; I was completely on my own to come up with my individual interpretation.<br/>
                Next, when I sat down to write, the words just did not come to me. My notes and ideas were all present, but the words were lost. I decided to try every prewriting strategy I could find. I brainstormed, made idea maps, and even wrote an outline. Eventually, after a lot of stress, my ideas became more organized and the words fell on the page. I had my interpretation of “The Myth of Sisyphus,” and I had my main reasons for interpreting the essay. I remember being unsure of myself, wondering if what I was saying made sense, or if I was even on the right track. Through all the uncertainty, I continued writing the best I could. I finished the conclusion paragraph, had my spouse proofread it for errors, and turned it in the next day simply hoping for the best.<br/>
                Then, a week or two later, came judgment day. The professor gave our papers back to us with grades and comments. I remember feeling simultaneously afraid and eager to get the paper back in my hands. It turned out, however, that I had nothing to worry about. The professor assigned me an A on the paper, and his notes suggested that I wrote an effective essay overall. He wrote that my reading of the essay was original and that my thoughts were well organized. My relief and newfound confidence upon reading his comments could not be overstated.<br/>
                What I learned through this process extended well beyond how to write a college paper. I learned to be open to new challenges. I never expected to enjoy a philosophy class and always expected to be a math and science person. This class and assignment, however, gave me the self-confidence, critical-thinking skills, and courage to try a new career path. I left engineering and went on to study law and eventually became a lawyer. More important, that class and paper helped me understand education differently. Instead of seeing college as a direct stepping stone to a career, I learned to see college as a place to first learn and then seek a career or enhance an existing career. By giving me the space to express my own interpretation and to argue for my own values, my philosophy class taught me the importance of education for education’s sake. That realization continues to pay dividends every day.</p>

                Certain books we’ve read live in our memories. When we first read these books or when they were read to us, they spoke to us in some important way. They may still speak to us. Find a book that played an important role in your life when you were a child or an adolescent. Why was it important? What was it like to read this book? Did you read it on your own or did someone read it to you? If someone read it to you, who was it, and what was the experience like? Is there a connection between this book and learning to read on your own?
                Re-read the book. (If it is long, like Little Women, for example, it is all right to skim it, although you may find yourself re-reading certain parts.) </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e52f361275414eb887a331d1837feb92" data-uuid="e52f361275414eb887a331d1837feb92">In your essay, use the book as a springboard for your writing by focusing on an insight (a discovery) you have made about the book. Be sure to cite passages and tell the effect they had on you.
                As you shape your drafts, give attention to organization, the way you build your story. Decide what the reader needs to know in the beginning, and think about the order the events happened and how much to tell the reader at each point. Give attention also to the pictures you create: try to reconstruct key moments by showing what happened rather than merely telling that it happened. Dialogue and scene descriptions often help to make those moments come alive. Finally, give careful thought to the story’s theme or controlling idea.</p>

This is different from an autobiography. Influential people, such as former U. S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, often write lengthy autobiographies depicting the many critical events of their lives and careers. But every writer has experienced a few critical events that will be of interest to people who do not know them.  These individual events are great topics for memoir.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-8452de0cdb9e4144b0b30c221b7b07d2" dir="ltr" data-uuid="8452de0cdb9e4144b0b30c221b7b07d2">According to Greg Martin, professor at UNM, when a person creates a memoir, the writer is examining a specific time in his/her life, and a very specific relationship--a relationship to a person or idea.  The memoir must be larger than the writer in that an outside reader could relate to themes or universal meaning in the text.</p>

So even two hundred pages of memoir needs focus. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-431a7e370e594e9cbc075a627e1fc4d2" dir="ltr" data-uuid="431a7e370e594e9cbc075a627e1fc4d2">Focus is central to any genre of writing--academic essays, business letters, memoirs, and so on. For this course, when you write a memoir, focus is even more important. Since you only have two to three pages to tell a story from your life, your persona (that is, you characterized on the page) should focus on a universal meaning you would like to relay to the reader and a relationship between you and something larger than yourself--a relationship to a person, an activity, a struggle.  Pick a short time period, or maybe even a moment, for this course’s assignment, and focus on relaying to the audience what made that event in your life special, important, life-changing</p>

            </p>
            <ol id="data-uuid-39ea61b94210462ea9ae2fdd909a978a" data-uuid="39ea61b94210462ea9ae2fdd909a978a">

            </ol>
            <p id="data-uuid-da117256c2fe4d63b2d0678e80613aa6" dir="ltr" data-uuid="da117256c2fe4d63b2d0678e80613aa6">The third point above is important because you always want to think about the reader when you write.  If you are writing a personal narrative, you aren’t just writing about yourself. You’re writing about the human experience, and what it means to live inside your body and your mind at this particular moment in time.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-1507b937409349b39e7953319bf20355" dir="ltr" data-uuid="1507b937409349b39e7953319bf20355">Here’s an example of how a reader can relate to a narrative. Think about a children’s story, take Cinderella for example.  She’s a nice, young lady; she’s so nice that even small animals are drawn to her. They know she won’t hurt them, but her family is mean, and they don’t see that she is special and beautiful.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-53202507e22447049d702a22768fe718" dir="ltr" data-uuid="53202507e22447049d702a22768fe718">Have you ever experienced or known someone who was not understood by a parental figure?  Have you ever snuck out at night to go to a party, especially if there was a super-hot host or hostess who invited you? Have you experienced being double-crossed? Have you ever been forced to do chores you didn’t want to do? Cinderella experienced all these struggles and the story compels the reader to connect with the audience. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e633a2e71fe44c08aee4e593a5c619f6" dir="ltr" data-uuid="e633a2e71fe44c08aee4e593a5c619f6">On many levels, this children’s story is relatable to an outside audience. Yes, it is fiction, and the fantastical elements might make it seem like an ordinary person couldn’t identify with the story; however, the specific details allow the reader to be immersed in the story and identify with the protagonist.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-9fd2917ff9294949a9822408173c4f5c" dir="ltr" data-uuid="9fd2917ff9294949a9822408173c4f5c">In this vein, you will write memoir.  The way to create a more human and relatable story is to write specific details, and reflect on the story and what it means to you now. Professor Greg Martin at UNM has said that one of the most important parts of writing memoir is reflection.  Reflection is you looking back on the events that you are describing and making sense of them. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e16f4d4e905549bc8bdef72f34cdc532" dir="ltr" data-uuid="e16f4d4e905549bc8bdef72f34cdc532">Reflection in memoir is similar to interpreting and analyzing evidence in an academic essay. When you read the Analytical Writing chapters in this textbook, you will notice that interpreting evidence and making sense of statistics or facts is important.  The same goes for writing memoir.  You have to write about why the situation you have narrated is important or universal--how does it relate to the reader? What did you learn?  What can we learn?  However, you don’t want to sound so dogmatic when you begin the reflection area of an essay because the reader will have his/her own interpretation of the events you describe. And that’s the hard part about memoir--once you create a piece of art and present it to an audience, the audience will have a different interpretation from what you have created. And that’s fine.  It’s part of the process of creating art--writing is art.  Creative writing should be lyrical, and lecturing never sounds pretty.  You can reflect by using other craft features like imagery and metaphor to help you create the meaning, theme, or universal wisdom in your story. But it's up to the reader to decide on meaning.</p>

We want Cheez-its!” Eh, maybe it didn’t happen quite like that.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Regardless, each month at my daughter’s school, in alphabetical order, parents are required to bring a snack, and I am usually ready days in advance. Sometimes I add a cute and Pinterest-y flourish—name tags for each kid, or on St. Patrick’s Day, each carrot cupcake had green clovers I cut out and attached to toothpicks. It wasn’t the healthiest snack, but at least there were carrots and raisins in the mix.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then one time I forgot.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I hadn’t checked my phone messages all morning, and in the afternoon, I had plenty: two from my daughter’s teacher and three from my husband who was confused—Jennifer always remembers snack, right? Upon reading the texts, I felt a familiar burning sensation run up my body—call it shame, humiliation, sadness. I’m pretty sure forgetting snack shouldn’t bring up a laundry list of self-defeating malevolence.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    When I was a teenager, my mom forgot a lot, mostly me, a few times after school, and at least once, when I was a toddler, she forgot me, restrained in my car seat while she locked her keys in a running car to fetch something inside our house. I had nightmares for years afterward that I was in the backseat of a car rolling erratically downhill with no one at the wheel. For this reason, I vowed to never forget anything as a parent.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then one time I forgot.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Who cares, right? Every parent forgets some things. But I care, mostly about my reaction—that burning sensation of shame. It worries me that I would feel like such a failure over something so minor. Sometimes I wish I had a doppelganger, a woman plump around her middle, soft in her thirties, who tries her best; she would be me but outside of me, there to let me feel for myself what I don’t feel: compassion. I would say out loud to her the things I think to myself, “How could you forget? How could you disappoint your daughter?” As my insults spiraled through the air, I’d hear my harsh tone. I’d understand why I need to quiet those voices.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I’m not completely sure of the difference between self-pity and self-sympathy. It’s a hard line to envision drawing for myself. I was always taught to suck things up: pity and pouting would get me nowhere. So I suck up the various blows life deals me, and that philosophy has certainly served me well, with a few exceptions, like when I forgot snack.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It’s sad that I could give more sympathy to doppelganger me than real me, the me who behaves more like a human than a super-mother. Real me doesn’t get my sympathy. I would like to feel for myself, even though it feels false and strange. I’ll try it:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i>Oh that Jennifer, she forgot her daughter’s snack. It’s understandable. Her semester does end in two weeks. One could see how she might forget. She’ll try harder next time. She will say everyone makes mistakes, even Mommy. She’ll realize the burning shame she feels is not something she wants to pass down. In place of sucking it up, she’ll keep striving for self-compassion, or self-sympathy, or even just the opposite of self-loathing.</i><br/>

When she is unable to achieve her own expectations, she feels self-loathing.  These are some heavy issues, and they were all sparked by forgetting snack for her daughter’s kindergarten class. The story becomes focused, and the trouble begins when she realizes that she forgot snack--forgetting snack is also the inciting incident, the trouble in the story that opens up the gateway to reflection and discovery.  The reflection in this memoir is not about Cheez-its; the reflection has to do with the protagonist reflecting on why she feels so terribly about forgetting the class snack.  </p>

Lastly, trust that when you tell your story and include conflict (something has to happen to somebody), create a protagonist with which the reader can identify, reflect on the events, and describe using plenty of detail, the reader will want to come along for the ride.</p>
