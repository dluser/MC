For example, if you wanted to explain why a show like <i>South Park</i> or <i>Family Guy</i> has particular appeal to young people today, you might contrast these shows with coming of age television series from other periods. For instance, you could contrast an episode of <i>South Park</i> with an episode of <i>Leave it to Beaver</i>, an iconic series from the 1950s. Though the main characters, Beaver and Wally Cleaver, often get into trouble, it is never anything like the kind that Eric Cartman gets into, and, unlike Cartman, who is spoiled by his single mother, the Cleaver kids are always able to talk out their difficulties with their father who helps them to learn from their mistakes at the end of each episode. Again, the conclusions you draw from this contrast could vary. You might assert that this relationship reveals the necessity of a strong father figure to keep children in check, you might suggest that the tightly controlled patriarchal family structure of the 1950s inspired rebellion and ridicule in the decades that followed, or you might come to conclusion somewhere in between these two extremes.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-af950128545a4d5bac6b55d2d1cecad6" data-uuid="af950128545a4d5bac6b55d2d1cecad6">
                Along these lines, you might also consider explaining your subject by contrasting it with how it could have been different by calling your reader's attention to the details that were deliberately omitted. For instance, you might analyze an advertisement by revealing what it doesn’t show about the product. Advertisements for fast food restaurants usually show families sitting together, relaxed, and having a good time, but they never show how people usually eat at these places, quickly and alone. And these ads certainly do not reveal the negative effects that eating too much fast food can have on the body, such as heart disease or obesity. Similarly, you can learn about how people feel about something or someone not only by the terms they use but also by the ones they refuse to use. For instance, if the first time you say “I love you” to your significant other only garners the response “thank you,” you might begin to suspect that your feelings run more deeply than those of your partner.</p>

So to fully explain how and why you came up with your assertions, you should also consider how your experiences, your values, even your mood at the moment of encounter can shed light on how you see your subject. As the above examples indicate, you might begin by considering how your surrounding culture influences your response. For instance, Thomas de Zengotita argues that Americans have become so used to media constructions of reality that they become bored with the real world that is unmitigated by it. To illustrate, he points out that if you were to see wolves in the wild, you might at first be fascinated, but then will quickly lose interest because the sight cannot measure up to the ones that you are used to seeing in movies and on television:</p>
            <blockquote id="data-uuid-51d41400d418417694e4a10b3964baac" data-uuid="51d41400d418417694e4a10b3964baac" class="blockquote blockquote-a">

The kids will start squirming in, like, five minutes; you’ll probably need to pretend you’re not getting bored for a while longer. But if that little smudge of canine out there in the distance continues to just loll around in the tall grass, and you don’t have a powerful tripod-supported telelens gizmo to play with, you will get bored. You will begin to appreciate how much technology and editing goes into making those nature shows.</p>

One reason many teachers do not allow students to use the word “I” is that they often overuse it. If every sentence began with the phrase “I see it this way because” the essay would soon become monotonous and repetitive. Most of the time, you do not need to use first person point of view (or similar phrases like “in my opinion”) because it is implied that as the writer you are expressing your point of view. This writing rule is often utilized for early college writing, and is in place to help students learn about the rule before they can effectively break the rule. There are times when using “I” will make your writing clearer, more accurate, and more meaningful than constructions that begin with generic subjects like “the reader,” “the viewer” or “one.” These terms can make it tempting to not justify our perspectives, because they can give the impression that all people see a subject in the same way; this simply isn’t true, as evidenced by the fact that we can use these terms to make contradictory assertions: </p>

Yet according to Joan Didion, one of the most prolific and respected essayists of our time, the nature of writing is never like this:</p>
        <blockquote id="data-uuid-0fc6efceb68345158c2f5709a8726778" data-uuid="0fc6efceb68345158c2f5709a8726778" class="blockquote blockquote-a">

It’s an aggressive, even a hostile act. You can disguise its aggressiveness all you want with veils of subordinate clauses and qualifiers and tentative subjunctives, with ellipses and evasions with the whole manner of intimating rather than claiming, of alluding rather than stating but there’s no getting around the fact that setting words on paper is the tactic of a secret bully, an invasion, an imposition of the writer’s sensibility on the reader's most private space.</p>

Consider this excerpt from <i>Of Idleness</i>:</p>
        <blockquote id="data-uuid-129f9db9a7ff40b0843ac447b72cae79" data-uuid="129f9db9a7ff40b0843ac447b72cae79" class="blockquote blockquote-a">

            Though not everyone will agree with your point of view, most will at least respect it if they see that you derived your assertions from a close consideration of the subject and did not just rely on a gut reaction based on a brief glance. Ultimately you will want to discuss your essay’s point of view with your instructor. Different genres and essay goals will dictate the need for a specific point of view.</p>
