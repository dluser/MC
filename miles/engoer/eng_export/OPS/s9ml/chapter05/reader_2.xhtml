            assignments—your readers—may not appear in person, they play a vital role in the development of your writing. Even in
            everyday writing activities, you identify your readers’ characteristics,
            interests, and expectations before making decisions about what you write. In
            fact, thinking about audience has become so common that you may not even detect
            the audience-driven decisions. We will spend this
            chapter focusing on the role the audience plays in your writing by reviewing
            information presented in the textbook <i>Successful
            Writing.</i></p>

            site with the awareness of who will digitally follow the post. If you want to
            brag about a good grade, you may write the post to please family members. If
            you want to describe a funny moment, you may write with your friends’ senses of
            humor in mind. Even at work, you send e-mails with an awareness of an
            unintended receiver who could intercept the message.</p>

                selecting an audience and a purpose, you must choose what information will make
                it to the page. Content may consist of examples, statistics, facts, anecdotes,
                testimonies, and observations, but no matter the type, the information must be
                appropriate and interesting for the audience and purpose. An essay written for
                third graders that summarizes the legislative process, for example, would have
                to contain succinct and simple content.</p>

                content, the audience will be more engaged, and you will build a stronger
                relationship with your readers. Consider the third grade audience mentioned earlier; you
                would choose simple content that the audience will easily understand, and you
                would express that content using an enthusiastic tone. The same
                considerations apply to all audiences and purposes.</p>

                probably heard that one quality found in good writing is voice. Voice refers to elements of the author's <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-304f4a550578440b8582220696065da0"><dfn title="304f4a550578440b8582220696065da0">tone</dfn></a>, phrasing, and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c620cd06173b445ca383fb9f0b3fda5d"><dfn title="c620cd06173b445ca383fb9f0b3fda5d">style</dfn></a>
                that are recognizably unique to her or him. Having a distinctive, persuasive
                voice is crucial to engaging your audience — without it, your
                paper risks falling flat, no matter how much research you've compiled or
                how well you've followed other directions. Yes, academic writing has rules
                about format, style, and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-8ae96e1107ed487f8ef563f24e3dc0bf"><dfn title="8ae96e1107ed487f8ef563f24e3dc0bf">objectivity</dfn></a> that you must
                follow, but this does not mean you can write boring, impersonal prose. You can
                — and should — develop an authorial voice no matter what subject you choose to write
                about. </p>

                each writer has a unique voice does not mean that each writer has a radically
                different style from anyone else. In academic writing, voice comes down to
                small habits and personal preferences. Think about it this way: if all the
                students in your class were told to explain a complex concept, none of them
                would do it in the same way. Each one would use different language and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-381fd400a07548d3a5ac7a51c71c3f64"><dfn title="381fd400a07548d3a5ac7a51c71c3f64">syntax</dfn></a> to describe the concept, and as each student makes individual choices in language and syntax
                over a period of time, their readers will eventually associate those choices with particular writers — their unique writing accumulates to create an authorial voice.</p>

                another person. You may pick up a person’s tone of voice fairly easily in
                conversation. A friend who tells you about her weekend may speak excitedly
                about a fun skiing trip. An instructor who means business may speak in a low,
                slow voice to emphasize her serious mood. Or, a coworker who needs to let off

                transmit a range of attitudes through writing, from excited and humorous to
                somber and critical. These emotions create connections among the audience, the
                author, and the subject, ultimately building a relationship between the
                audience and the text. To stimulate these connections, writers portray their
                attitudes and feelings with useful devices, such as sentence structure, word
                choice, punctuation, and formal or informal language. Keep in mind that the
                writer’s attitude should always appropriately match the audience and the
                purpose.</p>

                distinct <b>style</b>. You should maintain
                the distinctive elements of your voice and style in the academic context. Even
                when you're outside your comfortable, everyday environment, you can still find
                ways to express your unique style. Your writing
                style, especially your word choice (diction), should reflect the audience you
                are writing to. Always imagine who your
                hypothetical audience is (what type of publication would the content of your
                essay fit into?) and that will help you determine the specifics of your writing
                style. Academic essays usually require a
                formal style of writing. That means you should avoid unnecessary informality
                like first and second person usage, use of slang, and the temptation to write
                like you are texting, tweeting, emailing, blogging or engaging in any other
                genre that is typically characterized by a less formal style.</p>

            style. There are no quick ways to give yourself a recognizable voice; it is
            something that can only be developed over time. The best way to develop voice
            is to keep writing and to think about what kind of writing you like. Pay
            attention to how you speak — what words you use, what sorts of phrases and sentence
            structures you favor, even what kind of punctuation appears in your work

                requires many steps, and in order to ensure you have created a style that meets
                the needs of both the assignment and your reader, spend some time enhancing your
                word choices, developing your descriptions, and clarifying your sentence
                constructions. Here are a few tips to help you enhance your writing style as you
                continue working to complete your draft. </p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e48ec9dda9694287b910a1e7bf6a06f1" data-uuid="e48ec9dda9694287b910a1e7bf6a06f1">After you’ve finished
                writing a draft of your essay, go back and underline all the vague and general
                terms to see if you can replace them with more precise<b> <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-17e331b5b04942379bc39db8a0275238"><dfn title="17e331b5b04942379bc39db8a0275238">diction</dfn></a></b>,
                words that are clear and specific. Especially look out for the “s” word, and
                no, I do not mean the one that comes to almost everyone’s lips when they look
                in the rear view mirror and see flashing police lights. I mean “society.” By
                itself it can mean anything—the entire world, the specific part of the country
                you live in, the people who make the rules, the counter culture that resists
                the people who make the rules, to name just a few. If you can specify which
                “society” you are referring to, you will not only clarify your analysis but
                also discover new insights concerning the significance of your perspective to a
                specific group. And also try to avoid all the variations of society that do not
                provide additional clarity, such as: “in today’s society” or “in today’s modern
                complex industrial society.”</p>

                out for these vague terms and phrases: “The Government.” Try to specify if this
                term refers to state, local, or federal representatives, the people who vote
                them in, or to those who are paid through tax dollars, such as public school
                teachers, policeman, and armed service personnel. Another vague phrase is, “Since the beginning of
                time.” Try to specify when something actually begins. Personal computers, for
                instance, have not been around since the beginning of time, as one of my
                students wrote, but only since the late 1970s. Avoid broad generalizations
                like, “All people want to have…” No matter how you finish that sentence, you
                probably won’t discover something that all people want to have. Again, specify
                which group of people and why they want to have it. You should also be on the
                lookout for words like, “stuff,” “things,” or “items,” if you can replace them
                with more concrete terms like, “scattered papers,” “empty oil cans,” or “half
                finished plates of food.”</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-0558374b85974f47bdf20d01327f8c58" data-uuid="0558374b85974f47bdf20d01327f8c58">Give the same care and
                attention to your choice of verbs. You should especially avoid overusing the
                passive voice, in which the subject of the sentence does not perform the action
                as in “Tina was asked to go to the prom by Jake.” Usually the active voice
                sounds more vivid and more compelling, “Jake asked Tina to go to the prom.” And this sentence would be even better if you could replace the verb “asked” with one that gives
                a more specific account of the action: “Jake begged Tina to go to the Prom.”
                But don’t feel the need to eliminate the passive voice entirely. Sometimes you
                may not know who performed the action implied in the sentence, “my car was
                scratched” or you don’t want to admit responsibility for your own actions,
                “mistakes were made.” Just make certain that when you use a form of the verb
                “to be,” you do so for a reason and not in place of a verb that suggests a more
                vivid account. Ultimately, you want to avoid repetitively using any one verb in
                your writing. Vary your verb choices to create descriptive and engaging
                writing.</p>

                more precise and compelling words, I do not mean that you should search your
                thesaurus to find the longest and most complicated terms. Nothing makes
                students sound like they are trying too hard to impress their teachers than
                when they use words that appear unnecessarily complicated, dated, or
                pretentious to make the analysis seem more sophisticated. Though students often
                think that they impress their teachers by using the most complex term, it
                usually leaves the opposite impression that you are spending too much time with
                the thesaurus and not enough with the actual substance of the essay.</p>

                the other common trick of adding unnecessary words just to lengthen the essay
                out to the required number of pages. Instead always look for ways to state your
                point of view more succinctly. You can do this by using a term that
                implies several others. For instance, you do not need to write, “Sue is like
                those people who always put off doing what they are supposed to do until much
                later than they should have done it in the first place,” when you can simply
                say, “Sue procrastinates.”</p>

                precise, natural diction, you can jazz it up even further by creating sentence
                variety. A series of sentences of the
                same length and type tends to become hypnotic (in fact, hypnotists use
                rhythmical tones and repetitious phrases to put people into trances). Your
                essay should “flow” in the sense that the ideas connect to each other, but not
                in the sense that the style seems like listening to the waves of a lake lapping
                against the shore at steady intervals. A style that commands attention seems
                more like a river that changes at every bend. To achieve this effect, try to
                juxtapose sentences of various lengths and types. If you have a long sentence
                that is full of subordination and coordination, moving through the complexities
                of a section of your analysis, then try to follow it up with a short one. Like
                this.</p>

                achieve more variety, provide more coherence, and reduce wordiness is to
                combine some of your sentences. Take the following series: <i>I wanted some ice cream. There are ice cream shops downtown. I have to
                drive to get to downtown. I don’t have time to drive downtown. I’ve been
                putting on weight lately. I decided to eat a carrot. Carrots are healthier than
                ice cream</i>. Even if these sentences were full of more intriguing
                observations, we would have to struggle not to fall into a hypnotic trance
                while reading them. Consider how much more engaging it is to read: <i>I wanted some ice cream. But when I realized
                I had to drive all the way downtown to buy some, I decided to settle for a
                carrot instead, a much healthier choice for me anyway. I’ve put on weight
                lately</i>. The combination of short and long sentences keeps your reader's attention by
                jolting them out of a monotonous flow; the elimination of excess words keeps us
                from having to sort through the clutter; and the coordination and subordination
                provides a sense of coherence to the previously scattered thoughts.</p>
