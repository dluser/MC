The <i>Writers’ Handbook</i> suggests that after you have made some revisions to your draft based on feedback and your recalibration of your purpose for writing, you may now feel your essay is nearly complete. However, you should plan to read through the entire final draft at least one additional time. During this stage of editing and proofreading your entire essay, you should be looking for general consistency and clarity. Also, pay particular attention to parts of the paper you have moved around or changed in other ways to make sure that your new versions still work smoothly.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-451a6eec299d418786a1e6e93428e7bd" data-uuid="451a6eec299d418786a1e6e93428e7bd">Although you might think editing and proofreading isn’t necessary since you were fairly careful when you were writing, the truth is that even the brightest people and best writers make mistakes when they write. One of the main reasons that you are likely to make mistakes is that your mind and fingers are not always moving along at the same speed nor are they necessarily in sync. So what ends up on the page isn’t always exactly what you intended. A second reason is that, as you make changes and adjustments, you might not totally match up the original parts and revised parts. Finally, a third key reason for proofreading is because you likely have errors you typically make and proofreading gives you a chance to correct those errors.</p>

You can offer to be another pair of eyes for peers in exchange for their doing the same for you. Whether you are editing and proofreading your work or the work of a peer, the process is basically the same. Although the rest of this section assumes you are editing and proofreading your work, you can simply shift the personal issues, such as “Am I…” to a viewpoint that will work with a peer, such as “Is she…”</p>

The textbook <i>English for Business Success</i> explains that what writers need most is feedback from readers who can respond to both the words on the page and critique whether the writing responds to the assignment; this process is called peer review. The in-class (and sometimes online) peer review process provides writers with the opportunity to share their drafts with someone who can give an honest response about its strengths and weaknesses. Since your peers have participated in the same lectures, discussions, and group work, they can offer the most constructive and focused feedback based on the assignment and the instructor’s expectations. </p>

                Peer review can feel scary because you may feel uncomfortable sharing your writing at first, but remember that each writer is working toward the same goal: a final draft that fits the audience and the purpose. You and your peers have all the tools to offer advice since you have been working together, in the classroom, to understand the essay’s topic and genre. Maintaining a positive attitude when providing feedback will put you and your partner at ease. The sample peer review below provides a useful framework for the peer review process.</p>

            <p id="data-uuid-7afcd4f3b9f348259684bbd483938156" data-uuid="7afcd4f3b9f348259684bbd483938156">Students often worry about the peer review process, especially if they have never been asked to peer review before. The best way to address this fear is to accept that you will be unable to locate every error or weakness. Once you understand that the process is not perfect, it is easier to feel comfortable with your role as the reviewer. Here are a few tips that will help you during the peer review process:</p>
            <ol id="data-uuid-c8da2c96bec1425d9bde77f9a7fe91f9" data-uuid="c8da2c96bec1425d9bde77f9a7fe91f9">

Your instructor will likely have clear goals for the peer review process, and following the instructions will help you provide significant and meaningful revision ideas for your peer.</li>
                <li id="data-uuid-7e850799b8234c8690525fb7e889eb9f" data-uuid="7e850799b8234c8690525fb7e889eb9f">Read your peer’s essay from the beginning to the end without adding any comments. This first read allows you to grasp your peer’s intentions and focus.</li>
                <li id="data-uuid-409840c8577f49a5b780c689f2a62eeb" data-uuid="409840c8577f49a5b780c689f2a62eeb">Complete a second reading of your peer’s draft and start looking for strengths and weaknesses. Make comments on the margins of your peer’s essay. Later, you can further expand on these comments when you complete the peer review form.</li>
                <li id="data-uuid-dc94c9491d214794961c30f4901e355a" data-uuid="dc94c9491d214794961c30f4901e355a">When you feel stuck, stop and ask yourself “If this was my paper, how would I revise?”<br/>
                </li>
                <li id="data-uuid-56c776af8b3a42099fbf7de88a54b629" data-uuid="56c776af8b3a42099fbf7de88a54b629">Set aside time to review the organization of your peer’s essay. Read their thesis statement and make sure their body paragraphs have topic sentences that connect to their thesis statement. If there isn’t a clear connection, consider helping your peer revise their topic sentence so the connection between the thesis and body paragraph is easy to understand.<br/>
                </li>
                <li id="data-uuid-da4543f25d584c9db639c289a551aa82" data-uuid="da4543f25d584c9db639c289a551aa82">Be honest. Your peers want to earn the best grade they can and your advice during peer review will help them achieve this goal. Think of every piece of advice as constructive criticism. Your advice will help them to create a stronger, more focused writing sample.<br/>
