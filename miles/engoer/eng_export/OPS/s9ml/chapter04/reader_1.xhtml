            academic writing skills includes developing your own writing process. Your
            writing process includes all the steps you take from the time you receive a writing
            prompt to the time that you turn in a final draft for a grade.</p>

            this textbook, she shall remain nameless, described her own writing process as
            an undergrad: reading over the assignment prompt, stuffing the prompt into her
            backpack, losing the prompt, asking her teacher for another prompt, complaining
            that her teacher was mean when she asked for a new prompt, waiting until the
            night before the due date, writing until far past her bedtime, getting only
            three hours of sleep, and turning in the assignment.</p>

            different, and reflects years of experience. Now she reads over the expectations of her writing situation, considers
            her audience, develops her tone to match her audience’s expectations, writes in
            multiple sittings, asks a friend or colleague to read what she has written, and
            then makes her writing public.</p>

            however, that process might not work for you. We are all different. Our brains respond differently to the task of
            writing. Some people like to outline,
            some people like to create idea maps, and some people like to write all their
            ideas down and organize later.</p>

            perfectly acceptable--<b>your job as a college writer is to determine which
            process works best for you.</b> What circumstances provide you with the best
            opportunities to write? Once you figure
            out what works best for you, try to repeat that pattern each time you find
            yourself in a situation where you must write. Then you can proudly say that you
            have a writing process.</p>

                of writing assignments in college, and it would be nearly impossible to list
                all of them. However, regardless of genre, one can use some basic strategies to approach these assignments
                constructively.</p>
            <ul id="data-uuid-b4c04d5b22cf45b0bf5aa041f77bc237" data-uuid="b4c04d5b22cf45b0bf5aa041f77bc237">

                    temptation to skim it. Observe and interpret every detail of the text.
                    Moreover, it is essential to focus on the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-ef1f575dbc6c499fb2365057478e1644"><dfn title="ef1f575dbc6c499fb2365057478e1644">keywords</dfn></a> of the subject matter
                    being discussed. It would be unfortunate to hand in an incomplete or misguided
                    assignment because you did not properly read and understand the guidelines.
                    Since you can easily overlook details on the first reading, read the assignment
                    sheet a second time. As you are reading, highlight areas where you have
                    questions, and also mark words you feel are particularly important. <br /><br /> Ask
                    yourself why your professor has given this assignment. How does it relate to
                    what you are studying in class? Pay attention to key words, such as <i>compare</i>, <i>contrast</i>, <i>analyze</i>, etc.
                    Who is your audience? Should the paper be written in a formal or informal tone?
                    Is there documentation required? If a specific number of sources are required,
                    how many must be books vs. online sources? What type of citation is called for:
                    APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.? Is there a page or word count minimum/maximum? Are you
                    required to submit a draft before the final copy? Will there be peer review?</li><br />

                    the assignment sheet, you might not have questions right away. However, after
                    reading it again, either before or or after you try to start the assignment,
                    you might find that you have questions. Don't play a guessing game when it
                    comes to tackling assignment criteria--ask the right person for help: the
                    instructor. Discuss any and all questions with the person who assigned the
                    work, either in person or via email. Visit him or her during office hours or
                    stay after class.<br /><br /> Do not wait until the last minute, as doing so puts your
                    grade at risk. Don't be shy about asking your professors questions. Not only
                    will you better your understanding and the outcome of your paper, but professors
                    tend to enjoy and benefit from student inquiry, as questions help them rethink
                    their assignments and improve the clarity of their expectations. You are probably not the only student with a question, so be the one who is assertive and
                    responsible enough to find answers. In the worst case scenario, when you have completed all of these steps and a professor still fails to provide you with the
                    clarity you are looking for, discuss your questions with fellow classmates.</li><br />

                    consultants for reviewing writing assignments both before and after you begin.
                    If you feel somewhat confident about what you need to include in your writing
                    assignment, bring your completed outline and/or the first draft of your paper
                    together with your assignment sheet. Tutors can also review your final draft
                    before its submission to your professor. Details about CNM’s ACE Tutoring

                    due dates for the stage of your writing process, for example when you would
                    like to pick a topic and complete your rough draft. Procrastination rarely results in a good paper. Some school
                    libraries offer helpful computer programs that can create an effective
                    assignment timeline for you. This is a helpful option for new, inexperienced
                    writers who have not yet learned the art of analyzing assignments, and who are
                    not familiar with the amount of time that is required for the college writing
                    process. Remember, late papers may or may not be accepted by your instructor,
                    and even if they are your grade will likely be reduced. Don't sell yourself
                    short with late submissions.</li>

                the writing you turned in wasn’t quite what he/she was looking for? Chances
                are, if this has happened to you, the problem originated in your
                purpose. You probably did not perform
                the tasks that the teacher asked for in the assignment. You can find the tasks in an assignment

                contextualize, analyze, synthesize, or explicate in an assignment, and if you,
                in turn, merely summarize an assigned reading, you will miss out not only on
                points, but also educational objectives. Summary is often important in high school, where the purpose of writing
                assignments might be for the teacher to know you comprehend the material. For that reason, they may ask you to explain
                what happened in a story.</p>

                follow depending on the disciplines in which they teach. For that reason, when
                you receive any writing assignment prompt, you will need to analyze that
                assignment’s rhetorical situation. From <i>Successful
                Writing</i>, here is a section that discusses how to determine your rhetorical
                situation.</p>

                helpful to position yourself as a reader. Ask yourself whether you can focus
                easily on each point you make. One technique that effective writers use is to
                begin a fresh paragraph for each new idea they introduce.</p>

                logical, manageable chunks. One paragraph focuses on only one main idea and
                presents coherent sentences to support that one point. Because all the
                sentences in one paragraph support the same point, a paragraph may stand on its
                own. To create longer assignments and to discuss more than one point, writers
                group together paragraphs.</p>

                of your schedule and rules. Why write a letter to your congressman? To persuade

                reasons for writing often fulfill four main purposes: to summarize, to analyze,
                to synthesize, and to evaluate. You will encounter these four purposes not only
                as you read for your classes but also as you read for work or pleasure. Because
                reading and writing work together, your writing skills will improve as you

                assignments specifically designed to meet one of the four purposes. As you will
                see, the purpose for writing will guide you through each part of the paper,
                helping you make decisions about content and style. For now, identifying these
                purposes by reading paragraphs will prepare you to write individual paragraphs
                and to build longer assignments.</p>

                shrinks a large amount of information into only the essentials. You probably
                summarize events, books, and movies daily. Think about the last blockbuster
                movie you saw or the last novel you read. Chances are, at some point in a
                casual conversation with a friend, coworker, or classmate, you compressed all
                the action in a two-hour film or in a two-hundred-page book into a brief
                description of the major plot movements. While in conversation, you probably
                described the major highlights, or the main points in just a few sentences,
                using your own vocabulary and manner of speaking.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-e4af293633c54dceac93e533432de260" data-uuid="e4af293633c54dceac93e533432de260">Similarly, a summary paragraph condenses a long piece of
                writing into a smaller paragraph by extracting only the vital information. A
                summary uses only the writer’s own words. Like the summary’s purpose in daily
                conversation, the purpose of an academic summary paragraph is to maintain all
                the essential information from a longer document. Although shorter than the
                original piece of writing, a summary should still communicate all the key points
                and key support. In other words, summary paragraphs should be succinct and to
                the point.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of a college level reading that a student will need to summarize:</p>
            <section id="data-uuid-77c2e6fe0f2447a6802d8027e48defa3" data-uuid="77c2e6fe0f2447a6802d8027e48defa3" class="section section-a">

                <p id="data-uuid-21c2f711362c42ab80eec48f2296619c" data-uuid="21c2f711362c42ab80eec48f2296619c">     According to the Monitoring the Future Study, almost two-thirds of 10th-grade students reported having tried alcohol at least once in their lifetime, and two-fifths reported having been drunk at least once (Johnston et al. 2006x). Among 12th-grade students, these rates had risen to over three-quarters who reported having tried alcohol at least once. In terms of current alcohol use, 33.2 percent of the Nation's 10th graders and 47.0 percent of 12th graders reported having used alcohol at least once in the past 30 days; 17.6 percent and 30.2 percent, respectively, reported having had five or more drinks in a row in the past 2 weeks (sometimes called binge drinking); and 1.3 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, reported daily alcohol use (Johnston et al. 2006a).<br/>
                          Alcohol consumption continues to escalate after high school. In fact, eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds have the highest levels of alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence of any age group. In the first 2 years after high school, lifetime prevalence of alcohol use (based on 2005 follow-up surveys from the Monitoring the Future Study) was 81.8, 30-day use prevalence was 59 percent, and binge-drinking prevalence was 36.3 percent (Johnston et al. 2006b). Of note, college students on average drink more than their non-college peers, even though they drank less during high school than those who did not go on to college (Johnston et al. 2006a,b: Schulenberg and Maggs 2002). For example, in 2005, the rate of binge drinking for college students (1 to 4 years beyond high school) was 40.1 percent, whereas the rate for their non-college age mates was 35.1 percent.
                    <br/>
                          Alcohol use and problem drinking in late adolescence vary by sociodemographic characteristics. For example, the prevalence of alcohol use is higher for boys than for girls, higher for White and Hispanic adolescents than for African-American adolescents, and higher for those living in the north and north central United States than for those living in the South and West. Some of these relationships change with early adulthood, however. For example, although alcohol use in high school tends to be higher in areas with lower population density (i.e., rural areas) than in more densely populated areas, this relationship reverses during early adulthood (Johnston et al., 2006 a,b). Lower economic status (i.e., lower education level of parents) is associated with more alcohol use during the early high school years: by the end of high school, and during the transition to adulthood, this relationship changes, and youth from higher socioeconomic backgrounds consume greater amounts of alcohol.</p>

After high school, alcohol consumption increases further, and college-aged students have the highest levels of alcohol consumption and dependence of any age group. Alcohol use varies according to factors such as gender, race, geo-graphic location, and socioeconomic status.<br/>
                          Some of these trends may reverse in early adulthood. For example, adolescents of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to consume alcohol during high school years, whereas youth from higher socioeconomic status are more likely to consume alcohol in the years after high school. </p>

                        (Cl). Then, scientists would study how the two elements interact to create the

                        deconstructing compounds, academic analysis paragraphs typically deconstruct
                        documents. An analysis takes apart a primary source (an essay, a book, an
                        article, etc.) point by point. It communicates the main points of the document
                        by examining individual points and identifying how the points relate to one

Later in the report, they consider how various socioeconomic factors influence problem drinking in adolescence. The latter part of the report is far less specific and does not provide statistics or examples.<br/>
                                 The lack of specific information in the second part of the report raises several important questions. Why are teenagers in rural high schools more likely to drink than teenagers in urban areas? Where do they obtain alcohol? How do parental attitudes influence this trend? A follow-up study could compare several high schools in rural and urban areas to consider these issues and potentially find ways to reduce teenage alcohol consumption.</p>

                        to one another. By doing this, the student uncovers a discrepancy between the
                        points that are backed up by statistics and those that require additional
                        information. Analyzing a document involves a close examination of each of the

                    simple keyboard but displays a dashboard of switches, buttons, and levers. With
                    the flip of a few switches, a musician may combine the distinct sounds of a
                    piano, a flute, or a guitar—or any other combination of instruments—to create a
                    new sound. The purpose of the synthesizer is to blend together the notes from
                    individual instruments to form new, unique notes.</p>

                    documents into a new document. An academic synthesis paragraph considers the
                    main points from one or more pieces of writing and links the main points
                    together to create a new point, one not replicated in either document.</p>

However, this report is limited to assessing the rates of underage drinking, rather than considering methods of decreasing these rates. Several other studies, as well as original research among college students, provide insight into how these rates may be reduced. <br/>
                            One study, by Spoth, Greenberg, and Turrisi (2009) considers the impact of various types of interventions as a method for reducing alcohol consumption among minors. They conclude that although family-focused interventions for adolescents aged ten to fifteen have shown promise, there is a serious lack of interventions available for college-aged students who do not attend college. These students are among the highest risk level for alcohol abuse, a fact supported by Brown et al.<br/>
                              I did my own research and interviewed eight college students, four men and four women. I asked them when they first tried alcohol and what factors encouraged them to drink. All four men had tried alcohol by the age of thirteen. Three of the women had also tried alcohol by thirteen and the fourth had tried alcohol by fifteen. All eight students said that peer pressure, boredom, and the thrill of trying something illegal were motivating factors. These results support the research of Brown et al. However, they also raise an interesting point. If boredom is a motivating factor for underage drinking, maybe additional after school programs or other community measure could be introduced to dissuade teenagers from underage drinking. Based on my sources, further research is needed to show true preventative measures for teenage alcohol consumption.</p>

                    use information from each to create a new thesis. A good synthesis does not
                    repeat information; the writer uses a variety of sources to create a new idea.</p>

                    Evaluations in everyday experiences are often not only dictated by set
                    standards but also influenced by opinion and prior knowledge. For example, at
                    work, a supervisor may complete an employee evaluation by judging his
                    subordinate’s performance based on the company’s goals. If the company focuses
                    on improving communication, the supervisor will rate the employee’s customer
                    service according to a standard scale. However, the evaluation still depends on
                    the supervisor’s opinion and prior experience with the employee. The purpose of
                    the evaluation is to determine how well the employee performs at his or her
                    job.</p>

                    justifications, about a document or a topic of discussion. Evaluations are
                    influenced by your reading of the document, your prior knowledge, and your
                    prior experience with the topic or issue. Because an evaluation incorporates
                    your point of view and reasons for your point of view, it typically requires
                    more critical thinking and a combination of summary, analysis, and synthesis
                    skills. Thus evaluation paragraphs often follow summary, analysis, and
                    synthesis paragraphs. Read a student’s evaluation paragraph.</p>

They use several reputable sources to support their points. However, the report focuses solely on the frequency of alcohol use and how it varies according to certain sociodemographic factors. Other sources, such as Spoth, Greenberg, and Turrisi's study (2009) and the survey I conducted among college students, examine the reasons for alcohol use among young people and offer suggestions as to how to reduce the rates. Nonetheless, I think that Brown et al. offer a useful set of statistics from which to base further research into alcohol use among high school and college students.</p>

                    student’s personal judgment within the evaluation. Evaluating a document
                    requires prior knowledge that is often based on additional research. And if you include that outside research in
                    your paragraph, be sure to cite it. Check out part six of this book, either MLA

                    keywords--verbs--that will let you know what the purpose of an assignment
                    is. In an assignment prompt that

                        to summarize, you will know that your teacher wants to make sure you comprehend
                        the material, and the teacher would like you to re-state a text’s main ideas in

                    Each instructor is different. For that reason, if you have questions about the
                    purpose of an assignment, raise your hand in class and ask. Chances are,
                    someone else is thinking the same question. They might even thank you for asking the instructor to clarify his/her
                    request because getting the purpose incorrect in a writing assignment means
                    that you will not only miss out on a lot of points, but you will also miss out on
                    the educational objective for that assignment. </p>
