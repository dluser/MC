{"showButton":"Bloodless Reconquest?","hideButton":"Read more","answer":"In exchange for his successful reassertion of Spanish authority in New Mexico, Diego de Vargas hoped to receive the post of governor for life. Conflicts with the Santa Fe cabildo (or town council) and political intrigues required him to make his case before the viceroy and the king. By 1703, he had been reinstated as governor but he died shortly after his return to New Mexico. To honor his memory and to foster a sense of community and cooperation, New Mexico officials initiated the Santa Fe Fiesta in 1712. Since that time, historical memories of the reconquest have split in two. The reconquest is both a historical event and an invention of the organizers of the annual Santa Fe Fiesta. The Fiesta was intended to provide Pueblo and hispano residents of the colony with a point of convergence and unity. In doing so, its festivities ignored the violence and bloodshed of the years of conflict that characterized the reconquest between 1693 and 1696."}
