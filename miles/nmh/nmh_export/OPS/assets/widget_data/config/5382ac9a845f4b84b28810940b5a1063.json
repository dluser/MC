Along with Manuelito and Ganado Mucho, Barboncito initially led Navajo resistance to Kit Carson's campaign against them in 1863. Once Carson initiated his scorched earth campaign, however, Barboncito reasoned that surrender was the best course of action for his band. In 1868, the respected headman served as lead negotiator during talks with General Sherman that resulted in the Treaty of 1868.
