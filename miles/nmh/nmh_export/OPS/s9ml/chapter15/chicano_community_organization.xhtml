They were not willing to give up on the struggle that their ancestors had carried out since 1848. Over time, the methods of the land grant heirs changed. At times, they employed militancy, as in the cases of Las Gorras Blancas, La Mano Negra, and Alianza. At other moments they attempted to gain redress through the legal system by organizing their communities in groups like La Corporación de Abiquíu.</p>

Johnson’s Great Society initiative. With federal funds, they began their own community action program in the fall of 1967. The New Mexico Office of Economic Opportunity and the state-level Home Education Livelihood Program (H.E.L.P.) provided resources to help them market locally fabricated fencing.<br/>

Not long after it opened, local anti-land grant forces in the Chama Valley paid arsonists to destroy the clinic. The attack, however, did not end the community’s resolve. Supporters from across New Mexico contributed funds, building materials, and labor to repair the burned structures.</p>

La Clinica reopened in the spring of 1969 with the aid of new financing through the New Mexico Presbyterian Church. It was the first clinic in New Mexico to offer a sliding fee scale to provide wide access to health care for impoverished local communities.</p>

Reform in the 1960s was driven less by the idealistic hope of preserving local village cultures, and instead geared toward social and economic justice. Despite that shift, federal support for local initiatives to improve educational and economic opportunity were fleeting.

During the late 1970s Vallecitos residents launched La Madera Wood Products Cooperative to sell lumber and woodwork specific to New Mexican architectural styles, such as <i>vigas</i> and <i>latillas</i>. Despite initial successes, La Madera faced opposition from the competing Duke City Lumber Company as well as from the U.S. Forest Service. By the late spring of 1990, the Forest Service denied La Madera’s application to incorporate as an independent lumber harvester in the Carson National Forest. Forest Service officials denied the application on the grounds that La Madera did not own its own sawmill.<br/>

The basis of their claim was that the Duke City Lumber Company had harvested with official recognition in the Carson National Forest for a period of eighteen years, despite not owning its own sawmill. Plaintiffs charged that the denial of La Madera’s application was not only discriminatory, but it also violated earlier compacts that allowed for local communities’ use of forest resources.

U.S. Forest Service</i></a>, languished in the courts in the mid-1990s without definitive resolution. The defendants blocked the motion to hold individual forest rangers accountable for discrimination, and La Madera received the opportunity to revise an appeal but that initiative never gained traction.<br/>

In December they organized a prayer vigil in Santa Fe to help alleviate the contentious atmosphere. In doing so, however, they refused to back down. Nuevomexicano activists claimed that they had rights to the forests and natural resources of northern New Mexico based on the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The efforts of Duke City Lumber, the U.S. Forest Service, and Forest Guardians to prohibit their use of the land was “just another way of abrogating Chicano rights to moral and economic justice.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-7659b796b484440eb92e0d061c7b4441">15</a><br/>

Having lost their own grant lands, Ganados shepherds grazed their animals on allotments they had obtained from the Jicarilla Apache Tribe on territory now claimed by the state Department of Game and Fish. With no place for their sheep, Ganados herders drove their herds onto the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-53e575ed4f8a4008a7bca8eaf9a1019e"><dfn title="53e575ed4f8a4008a7bca8eaf9a1019e">Humphries Wildlife Management Area</dfn></a>.

Due to high profile acts of occupation, such as those staged by Alianza and Ganados ranchers, state and federal officials negotiated settlements with nuevomexicanos in the mid-1990s that did not hold because the lack of summer grazing lands jeopardized the ability of organizations like Ganados to keep their sheep from dying out.

Alianza and different groups involved  with the national-level Chicano movement had supported the creation of La Raza Unida Party in south Texas in the late 1960s. A New Mexico chapter of the party was formed in late 1971 and its adherents actively participated in the national conventions. The party had a presence in Bernalillo, Doña Ana, Grant, Lea, Rio Arriba, Santa Fe, San Miguel, Taos, and Union counties. Local groups tended to focus on the issues that were most critical to them. For example, in Rio Arriba and Union counties, party members focused on police brutality while labor issues were the main concern in Taos County. In San Miguel county, Marxist ideologies influenced party members who also participated in the Socialist Workers Party movement.<br/>

Established politicians prevented <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-e3fe941767314b87b5ae4f39c2a5cd24"><dfn title="e3fe941767314b87b5ae4f39c2a5cd24">La Raza Unida Party</dfn></a> from placing its candidates on the ballot by erecting bureaucratic obstacles. Most candidates ran write-in campaigns rather than bow to the pressure. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f8939ab5081e46058f17a4ed75037706"><dfn title="f8939ab5081e46058f17a4ed75037706">Juan José Peña</dfn></a>, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-aedcb2f2dbeb43e2b50860dec3538bd0"><dfn title="aedcb2f2dbeb43e2b50860dec3538bd0">Pedro Rodríguez</dfn></a>, and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-25dab9fbe9ee438e90519c3e8ae01ff8"><dfn title="25dab9fbe9ee438e90519c3e8ae01ff8">Manuel Archuleta</dfn></a> were among the earliest to campaign as members of La Raza Unida Party in New Mexico.<br/>

Only Otero, Rio Arriba, and San Miguel counties had active Raza Unida groups by the end of the decade. Still, the party also served to unite nuevomexicanos through cultural outreach. Artists Jesús Aragón and Francisco LeFebre contributed to the effort by creating silkscreen posters, woodcuts, and flags that broadcast the symbol their icon “La Familia” and party slogans. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-874c0b7ea7c94a5d87ebcfa3d49faa77"><dfn title="874c0b7ea7c94a5d87ebcfa3d49faa77">Roberto Archuleta</dfn></a> organized <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-5b449a217938440ca484e31c42ff8f05"><dfn title="5b449a217938440ca484e31c42ff8f05">El Teatro Norteño</dfn></a> as a traveling troupe that presented Chicano- and nuevomexicano-themed plays throughout the state.<br/>

The party’s labor committee and Chicano activists supported strikes throughout the state in the 1970s in an effort to secure improved working conditions for nuevomexicanos. Striking sanitation workers in Artesia enjoyed the support of Chicano organizations throughout the state, as well as from César Chávez, who visited the strikers several times in support of their action. The eventual settlement with the sanitation department achieved the strikers’ goals.<br/>

In all, the efforts of Chicano civil rights activists had a significant impact on New Mexico in terms of access to land, resources, and the political system—even if the result was not the one envisioned by Tijerina and land grant activists in the 1960s.<br/>
