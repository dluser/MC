Also, as was the case for Chicanos, access to land and resources lay at the center of Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache civil rights activism in the period between 1950 and 1970. Most of New Mexico’s Native Americans did not participate in the more militant manifestations of the civil rights era, such as the Red Power movement or the<a href="http://www.aimovement.org/ggc/history.html"> American Indian Movement</a> (AIM), but they used other methods to advocate for equal treatment before the law and status as U.S. citizens.</p>

Their ability to do so should not be underestimated: they have endured three colonial impositions under Spanish, Mexican, and then U.S. administration.  <br/>

As was the case with many nuevomexicano villages, Pueblos faced depopulation due to the increasing need to relocate to towns and cities that offered more employment opportunities than could be found within Pueblos themselves. Also, as was noted in Chapter 14, atomic developments in New Mexico appropriated Native peoples’ lands and resources—in the form of land for Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) and for the extraction of uranium.<br/>

Due to such developments, Dunbar-Ortiz concluded that “northern New Mexico had been brought into the mainstream of the American economic system and it resembled other depressed rural areas of the United States—parts of the Deep South and Appalachia, for example.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-a7865bb2f14d416ebeb4e1a2432a3022">26</a> In furthering this perspective, Dunbar-Ortiz highlights the continued legacies of colonialism in New Mexico.<br/>

Several witnesses who testified before the Senate Subcommittee worried that the return of Blue Lake would set a “dangerous precedent.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-21fad5ea4bd94abdbfe181d4a4333264">27</a> Senators finally reached the conclusion that the Taos case was sufficiently unusual to bar the creation of a precedent, and the measure succeeded.<br/>

As soon as the order was issued, Pueblo leadership initiated a legal battle to regain rights over the sacred landscape.<br/>

The treaty guaranteed land titles from the Spanish and Mexican eras. In a 1955 press release, the council cited a passage from the <i>Recopilación de las Leyes de las Indias</i> as evidence that the Spanish Crown had granted them control over Blue Lake.<br/>

Rather than turn to militancy, however, members of Taos Pueblo continued their patient appeals to the U.S. Congress as a means of regaining their sacred site. They also initiated a campaign to inspire public support for their claim, based on the notion of religious freedom—an idea that resonated with many Americans in the 1950s and 1960s.<br/>

Accordingly, the Taos Pueblo Council threw its support behind a bill proposed in the House that included their full claim.

In the Senate, the bill passed by a measure of seventy to twelve, illustrating the impact of the pueblo’s publicity campaign in popularizing the conflict. Then, on August 14 and 15, 1971, the people of Taos Pueblo celebrated their victory by inviting outsiders to participate in festivities that included traditional dances and feasts, as well as commemorative speeches.<br/>

Early in his political career, he resolved to support measures that would bring income to the Mescalero reservation, a place isolated from principal transportation corridors in south-central New Mexico. In the late 1950s, he worked with other members of the tribal council to create Apache Summit, a modest development geared to bring tourists to Mescalero lands during the ski season.

Along with the hotel, the resort included a golf course and two man-made lakes. Water to fill the lakes was pumped from one side of the reservation to the other, an action that drew criticism from the New Mexico State Engineer. Chino filed a lawsuit on behalf of the tribe, and argued “this is the aboriginal home of the Mescaleros.

New Mexico’s Fish and Game Bureau continued to enforce state regulations on Mescalero lands until the tribe filed another suit against the state. In 1983, the Mescaleros once again emerged victorious.<br/>

Yet by the early 1990s, many began to raise the question of the environmental and cultural costs of the measures that Chino so staunchly supported. The opposition gained traction when Chino supported an initiative to store nuclear waste on Mescalero lands.<br/>

In their words, the initiative was “in the best interest of tribal people, utilizing the best technological knowledge and expertise in the nuclear waste field.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-280217f9fca7474a841cc8e20ad97209">33</a><br/>

On January 31, 1995, a tribal vote defeated the measure by a<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/us/apache-tribe-rejects-move-to-store-nuclear-waste-on-reservation.html"> 490 to 362 vote</a>. Despite the defeat, Chino and his supporters circulated a petition that called for another vote on the issue. The second vote reversed the decision, passing the proposal by a measure of<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/us/nuclear-waste-dump-gets-tribe-s-approval-in-re-vote.html"> 593 to 372</a>. Almost immediately after the election, opponents accused supporters of corruption. They alleged that tribal members had been promised a payment of $2,000 each if the measure passed. Additionally, members of the opposition, including some traditional female Mescalero leaders, reportedly received threats and harassment by the measure’s proponents. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-a2eb3d91775641dab020bf7e694a9bd9"><dfn title="a2eb3d91775641dab020bf7e694a9bd9">Rufina Marie Laws</dfn></a> and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-682fe0e4cf834df7a3ca9a2c02a3f93e"><dfn title="682fe0e4cf834df7a3ca9a2c02a3f93e">Joseph Geronimo</dfn></a> were among those who endured such treatment.<br/>

Udall believed that “tribal leadership [had] strong-armed members” to change the result.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-c0295afe73164cfc914068659335cbf7">34</a> Within the Mescalero tribe, the episode fostered factionalism, conflict, and bitterness. Former council vice president <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-5591c9383146455b9c4d355acc66c284"><dfn title="5591c9383146455b9c4d355acc66c284">Fred Peso</dfn></a> emerged as a staunch opponent of Chino’s leadership, but much of the controversy abated when several national utilities revoked their support for the proposed nuclear waste relocation project. When the Power Company of Minnesota backed out of the deal, Congress discontinued funding for the proposal.<br/>

In 1984 Acoma Pueblo became the first in New Mexico to use bingo as a means of raising tribal funds; following the a Supreme Court decision in<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_1708"> <i>California v.

Conflicts over access to land and resources are still part of daily life for nuevomexicanos, Pueblos, Apaches, and Navajos. The anti-discrimination measures of the 1950s and 1960s have contributed to increased opportunities for people of all racial backgrounds in the state, but poverty and the need for additional educational and economic opportunities continue. Self-determination remains an important goal for nuevomexicanos and indigenous peoples throughout the state.<br/>
