Spanish was his native language; he did not learn to speak English until he was about twelve years old. As a teenager, he participated in a three-year Assembly of God education program near El Paso. Upon graduation at age eighteen, Tijerina worked as an evangelical missionary on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. His religious background informed the tone of his later activism.</p>

Local agriculturists and mining interests, however, opposed his moves to help working-class hispanos gain a modicum of economic independence. Resistance to the community forced Tijerina to relocate with his family to northern New Mexico where he intended to continue his ministry and his organization of Mexican Americans in support of their economic, social, and political rights.<br/>

When he settled in New Mexico in 1959, his commitment to nuevomexicano land disputes solidified. He saw the land grant heirs as people with cultural, historical, and numerical strength. Within the existing class and political structure of New Mexico, Tijerina believed that nuevomexicanos “could make their rights felt in the eyes of the government.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-065986a6c4bf4736a08ad65712c0ad06">3</a><br/>

Those associated with La Mano Negra destroyed fences and barns, and attempted to intimidate outsiders looking to purchase grant lands, much as had been the case with <i>Las Gorras Blancas</i> in the late nineteenth century. In the late 1930s, land grant heirs had also organized <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-139dc69d10ba4f18a6230136fc8bad1b"><dfn title="139dc69d10ba4f18a6230136fc8bad1b">La Corporación de Abiquíu</dfn></a> which sought to work within the legal system to restore rights to lands and resources.<br/>

They also introduced him to members of local advocacy groups and informed him of their methods and approaches. Tijerina provided the existing movement with national notoriety and connections to other civil rights groups. It is crucial to understand his central role in the land grant activism of the 1960s, but to also recognize the long historical roots of the struggle.<br/>

Alianza attempted to bring together all heirs of land grants that had been in existence when the treaty had been formalized in 1848. In organizing Alianza, Tijerina asserted that “none of these grant lands and waters which the United States asserts it acquired from Mexico under the treaty . . . ever formed any part of the public domain. These lands and waters therefore cannot be taken for that purpose.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-1e12e41b8bd14352946442eb5cb85b70">4</a><br/>

As Alianza made claims for the restoration of northern New Mexico land grants, in particular the San Joaquín del Río Chama and Tierra Amarilla grants, the group cited the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Indies"> <i>Recopilación de leyes de las Indias</i></a>, a seventeenth-century Spanish legal tract. The Recopilación helped Alianza to establish the original delineation of New Mexican land grants, and, according to the group, the U.S. government had violated articles VIII and IX of the 1848 treaty. Those were the articles that had guaranteed U.S. citizenship and property rights to former residents of Mexico.<br/>

Under Tijerina’s leadership, the group also tried to forcibly retake control of lands granted under Spanish and Mexican law, and guaranteed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In order to stake the claims of land grant heirs, Alianza set up the Republic of San Joaquín del Río Chama in the Kit Carson National Forest in 1966. That October, a confrontation occurred between forest rangers and Alianza members. Alianza took three rangers prisoner, convicted them of trespassing on their lands, granted them suspended sentences, and released them, along with their trucks.

Their goal was to make a citizens’ arrest of district attorney Alfonso Sánchez in response to his efforts to prevent Alianza members from gathering and organizing meetings. Aliancistas charged Sánchez’s actions, which included setting up roadblocks and arresting Aliancistas on outdated charges, violated their First Amendment right to assembly.<br/>

As they sought to locate him, the Aliancistas shot and wounded a state police officer and a jailer before fleeing into nearby mountains with two hostages. The prisoners were soon freed, and most of the Aliancistas surrendered within two days of the raid. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-783f9f98911a4a3b87ece3030f275846"><dfn title="783f9f98911a4a3b87ece3030f275846">E.

During the manhunt, the combined law enforcement detail used two tanks, several helicopters, spotter planes, a hospital van, and patrol jeeps to search for Tijerina. When they were unable to locate him, a group of about fifty nuevomexicanos, including men, women, and children, were detained in the elements without shelter, food, or water as bait to force Tijerina’s surrender. Within five days of the raid, Tijerina submitted to the authorities.<br/>

The courthouse raid drew television crews and journalists to the area and brought Alianza’s struggle to restore Spanish- and Mexican-era land grants to the nation’s attention. Some heralded Tijerina as a hero of an oppressed group of people; others emphasized the “backward” and seemingly pre-modern lifeways and culture of nuevomexicano people at the heart of the struggle. That more stereotypical perspective appeared in an NBC report on the raid that aired in 1967.<br/>

Those belonging to the rico nuevomexicano old guard considered Tijerina an outsider and a troublemaker who merely wanted to make a name for himself at the expense of local communities. Senator Joseph Sánchez—at the time the highest-ranking hispano politician in New Mexico, for example, lashed out against Tijerina. He declared that the “last thing the Spanish-speaking need is agitation, rabble rousing, or creation of false hopes,” all ostensibly things that Tijerina was responsible for.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-fe5a9127e80344dbab2e08571c121b71">7</a><br/>

In recent years, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo’s central role in the history of New Mexico has been recognized by scholars and residents of the Southwest alike. Such was not the case in the 1960s. At that time, efforts to highlight the economic, social, and political inequalities rampant in New Mexico was cast as an attempt to stir up racial animosities and cause trouble. The <i>Albuquerque Tribune</i> considered Tijerina within that context. In 1967 the paper reported that the land grant movement was a “fraudulent effort to read Spanish-Americans out of the white race,” and thus as a “reprehensible attempt to divide and exploit.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-777e2e1a2463447c9854dace173ab50d">8</a><br/>

Instead, the judge told him that he had thirty minutes to prepare his own defense. Under pressure, he argued that those involved in the courthouse raid simply hoped to make a citizens’ arrest of district attorney Sánchez in order to assert their constitutional right to assembly. The prosecution was not prepared for his line of argumentation, nor his moving oratory, and the trial concluded with the acquittal of all charges.<br/>

At that point, counterinsurgency methods were employed by the FBI to deny the legitimacy of Alianza’s actions. Tijerina himself was dubbed a communist sympathizer in the press, despite his personal opposition to communist economic ideologies. During the Cold War, however, to be labeled a communist was to be labeled an enemy to the national good.<br/>

Edgar Hoover had requested that a special index be established to keep track of alleged communist influences on civil rights groups. As far as the FBI was concerned, movements to promote the civil rights of groups considered to be racial minorities were inherently subversive and threatening to the interests of the United States. By 1967, Hoover created the “Rabble Rouser Index,” a system to identify and undermine the actions of “racial agitators and individuals who have demonstrated a potential for fomenting racial discord.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-2d4f256162ea469bb8822dbd311962e7">9</a><br/>

Hoover directed agents in FBI field offices to draw up “wide-ranging and detailed plans of action against Rabble Rouser targets.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-a446367641fc4f37bc8936e5ff27eb75">10</a> Tijerina was identified as one of the key Rabble Rousers or Agitators worthy of special action. Following his acquittal and release in December 1968, FBI agents intensified efforts to undermine Alianza. The homes of Aliancistas were mysteriously firebombed, and no official investigations made. According to the records of the Albuquerque FBI field office, “due to the controversial nature of the group, no investigation shall be conducted.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-ddf24d46ba634e2f8dac5bf53a50470d">11</a><br/>

His wife had set fire to a forest service sign, but he took the blame for the action and was arrested. The judge in the case revoked his bail from the 1967 conviction and once again charged him for his participation in the courthouse raid. Despite defense appeals to prohibitions on double jeopardy, the 1968 trial resulted in Tijerina’s conviction. He was sentenced to serve a prison term first at the Federal Correctional Facility at La Tuna in Anthony, New Mexico, and he was later moved to the federal facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.<br/>

During that period, Alianza’s activities and legitimacy declined. Following his release in 1971, Tijerina himself declared that he had “outgrown militancy,” and he adopted a softer line toward land grant issues—although he never gave up the struggle for the restoration of land and water rights in northern New Mexico until his death in January of 2015.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-746dad21d5a6472991012f28b791820d">12</a><br/>
