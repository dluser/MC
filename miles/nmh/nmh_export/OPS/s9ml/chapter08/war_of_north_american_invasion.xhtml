Among British colonists’ many grievances against the government in London was the enforcement of the Proclamation of 1763, which forbade expansion beyond the Appalachian Mountains. Although the term <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-eb875d7882de42db95f5a84625a4a804"><dfn title="eb875d7882de42db95f5a84625a4a804">Manifest Destiny</dfn></a> was not coined until 1845 in John O’Sullivan’s work in the <i>Democratic Review</i>, the idea that the United States had the right to expand westward from ocean to ocean was nothing new. O’Sullivan placed a label on the expansionist emphasis of the political discourse that took shape during the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c2ea044c567044a4932b6bca9ac4e41d"><dfn title="c2ea044c567044a4932b6bca9ac4e41d">Election of 1844</dfn></a>. Prior to that time, sectional differences based on slavery expressly prevented the annexation of lands west of the Mississippi River. The fear was that the balance of free and slave states that had been struck by the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Missouri.html">Compromise of 1820</a>, or Missouri Compromise, would be shattered if the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

Southerners hoped that the West would provide an opportunity to expand and solidify the institution of slavery as a viable economic system. Congressional negotiations, like the Missouri Compromise, maintained a tense unity between the states. The specter of westward expansion, however, promised to undermine the unquiet union. For precisely this reason, President <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-3dcc53e54ac248c7bc9e34a957830f5d"><dfn title="3dcc53e54ac248c7bc9e34a957830f5d">Martin Van Buren</dfn></a> refused Texas’ pleas for annexation in 1836.<br/>

By the early 1840s, the United States became more and more preoccupied with the Oregon Territory, part of an area which had been disputed by Russia, Spain, Britain, and the United States earlier in the century. An 1818 agreement between the United States and Britain allowed fur trappers from both nations to work in Oregon—by that time Russia and Spain no longer attempted to assert their claims. Most American settlers chose the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-d3df1070f9e34255a5d77e011b901bd6"><dfn title="d3df1070f9e34255a5d77e011b901bd6">Willamette Valley</dfn></a>, between California and the Columbia River, for their homesteads.

Most of these people heralded from Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and they looked to Oregon as a place where they could make a new start as independent family farmers. Over the next two years, another 5,000 reached Oregon Territory.<br/>

Other Americans had arrived in the early 1830s both overland and by sea. As in the case of Oregon, booster literature targeted potential migrants to northern California. In the late 1830s, Alta California was only sparsely inhabited by Mexican citizens and indigenous peoples along the line of presidios and missions that had been established along the coast by Juan Bautista de Anza and others in the late 1700s.<br/>

Many intermarried into local rico and mestizo families in order to expand their stake in California cattle ranching, the main economic enterprise there. A few, like <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-d7a5b2fce7fc40fcba80c23597d2a883"><dfn title="d7a5b2fce7fc40fcba80c23597d2a883">Thomas Oliver Larkin</dfn></a> who arrived in California in 1832, plotted for eventual annexation to the United States. Generally, these men were either squatters or landowners of questionable legality. Larkin, on the other hand, had constructed a successful mercantile enterprise in Monterey. In 1843, he was named U.S. consul in the same city. He penned a series of letters that in part inspired a new wave of migration to northern California. Those who arrived between 1843 and 1846, however, were cut from a different cloth than earlier arrivals. They tended to arrive overland rather than by sea, and very few intermarried into californio families. Rather than integrate into the local culture, they stood apart—a development that seemed to play into Larkin’s dream of Americanizing the region.<br/>

Expansion across North America was ordained to accommodate the rapidly expanding population of the United States. O’Sullivan argued that the U.S. “true title” to the continent superseded any other nations’ or peoples’ competing claims to territory and resources based on prior discovery or settlement. Unlike many others, however, O’Sullivan insisted that the way to continental domination was to be peaceful through “Anglo-Saxon emigration.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-4200edc16def4f198187d8d26a1eaa82">5</a> Although not produced until 1872,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_progress.JPG"> John Gast’s “American Progress”</a> offers a striking visual representation of the ideals of Manifest Destiny.<br/>

Issues surrounding the potential proliferation of slavery kept westward expansion on the back burner. The electoral campaign of 1844 placed westward expansion front and center, however, and served to alter public opinion. As the election neared, rumors abounded that Britain wished to annex California to pay debts owed it by Mexico and that the British also had designs on Texas and Spanish Cuba.

He also built a promising political career, spending fourteen years in Congress—four as Speaker of the House—and two years as governor of Tennessee. During the campaign, his slogan was “<a href="http://www.ushistory.org/us/29b.asp">54° 40’ or fight!</a>” He trumpeted his party’s assertion that both Texas and Oregon already belonged to the United States by virtue of the large Anglo-American populations in both regions.<br/>

Just before he did, news of a skirmish on April 25 between U.S. and Mexican forces that left “some sixteen [American soldiers] killed or wounded” reached Washington D.C.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-6fe041bf2c6e464aaa8072b8876bd82a">7</a> After hastily revising his speech, Polk approached Congress for a declaration of war. He framed the relationship between the United States and Mexico as one in which Americans had been forced to patiently endure a series of diplomatic, economic, and military abuses from its southern neighbor. Under such circumstances, and considering that “Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory, and shed American blood upon American soil,” a declaration of war was warranted.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-3a9ebfda6dcb48549d85caae6495613f">8</a> Despite some dissent from Whig Congressmen, including Representative <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-948455d0528f4ec093136022f7c26d7b"><dfn title="948455d0528f4ec093136022f7c26d7b">Abraham Lincoln</dfn></a>, Polk’s tactics proved effective, and the United States declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846.<br/>

Due to the controversy over the Nueces Strip, Mexican military and political officials alike considered their actions to be in defense against a U.S. invasion of their territory. Polk’s assertion that “American blood” had been shed upon “American soil” was untenable. Indeed, the title that has been given to the conflict south of the Rio Grande is telling. In Mexico, it is known as the “War of North American Invasion” or the “U.S. Invasion.” Following the U.S. declaration of war, most Mexicans echoed the sentiments expressed in the daily <i>El Tiempo</i>: “The American government acted like a bandit who came upon a traveler.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-d0dd46a62e71473294c91893ba1dac00">9</a> Many Mexicans attempted to arm themselves and join the effort to hold off the invasion, and most did not believe that the conflict would be as one-sided in favor of the United States as it proved to be. One of the major reasons for lopsided military contests was the reality that, for Mexico, the U.S. initiated a second war. As historian Brian DeLay has demonstrated, northern Mexico had already been devastated by the War of a Thousand Deserts. Under the circumstances, Mexican soldiers and citizens alike found it extremely difficult to repel U.S. forces.<br/>

While it was true that he was able to take possession of key New Mexico towns such as Las Vegas and the capital city without any major battles, recent scholarship has shown the idea of U.S. “bloodless occupation” of New Mexico to be a myth. Most nuevomexicanos were shocked and bewildered by the sweeping ability of the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-13294a5914174398bed0366b79ed25a1"><dfn title="13294a5914174398bed0366b79ed25a1">Army of the West</dfn></a> to capture their department. After marching into Las Vegas on August 15, Kearny made a speech before the town. He promised that nuevomexicanos would be included in the actions of the U.S. republic from that day forth, and he leveraged local apprehensions about native attacks in his discourse.<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_RAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=notes+of+a+military+reconnaissance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ujFYU8-XNs2uyAS8g4G4CA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"> As recorded by William Emory</a>, Kearny stated: “The Apaches and the Navajhoes [sic] come down from the mountains and carry off your sheep, and even your women, whenever they please. My government will correct all this.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-5e8e4404ca4f4b8db5c459d349127a71">10</a> As circumstances had it, the Army of the West arrived in Las Vegas not long after Navajo raiders had stolen its residents’ sheep and cattle. Kearny understood the impact of the War of a Thousand Deserts on nuevomexicanos, and he leveraged that knowledge to facilitate the conquest.<br/>

In an effort to protect the Santa Fe Trade and hasten the overall war effort, he ordered Kearny to occupy (rather than conquer) the territory. Due to this charge, many of the reports issued by Kearny and his men emphasized their means of “peaceful persuasion” in New Mexico.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-ea751373a3f44306aaf5b9f124f8bfa3">11</a> Their tenor contributed in part to the creation of the idea that most nuevomexicanos passively allowed, or even invited, the Army of the West to take control of their homeland. The writings of Santa Fe traders, principally Josiah Gregg, also provided fodder for early U.S. historians of the Southwest, such as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-64db981db4f14e859c10d10ee6ea4ce7"><dfn title="64db981db4f14e859c10d10ee6ea4ce7">Herbert Howe Bancroft</dfn></a>, who sought to justify the U.S.-Mexico War with the ideology of Manifest Destiny.

As a beneficiary of the Santa Fe Trade, Armijo depended on the U.S. economy for his wealth. Yet he also had his own reputation to consider as the Army of the West approached Santa Fe. He had been riding high due to his capture of the Texan-Santa Fe expedition a few years earlier. The 1,600-man Army of the West, however, presented a far more formidable threat than the nearly 300 starving and dehydrated Texans. Although he led a group of 1,800 volunteers to meet Kearny on August 14, three days later Armijo decided to disband his forces and retreat to Chihuahua. Kearny marched into the capital city uncontested.<br/>

According to their letter, most nuevomexicanos planned to resist the Army of the West but had been abandoned by their leader in the moment of necessity. Even Donaciano Vigil––who had counseled Armijo to retreat due to the superiority of the U.S. force––condemned him after the fact for abandoning New Mexico.<br/>

If the New Mexicans had been willing to fight, why did they not do so despite Armijo’s retreat? On the other side of the situation, why did Armijo abandon New Mexico? His motives were much more complex and murky than his letter made them seem. In an effort to comply with Polk’s order to peacefully occupy New Mexico, Kearny enlisted the aid of the well-connected trader James Magoffin. Magoffin and Armijo knew one another personally, and they held a closed-door meeting in late July or early August that also included the governor’s second-in-command, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c5fd5a3538e2476a8636f03ab673ddac"><dfn title="c5fd5a3538e2476a8636f03ab673ddac">Diego de Archuleta</dfn></a>. Magoffin’s mission was to persuade Armijo to surrender Santa Fe without a fight. Archuleta reportedly was incensed at the offer and he nearly persuaded Armijo to walk out of the meeting.

At the local level, Kearny worked to ensure the continued leadership of existing ayuntamientos, alcaldes, and judges. Charles Bent, partner with his brother William in Bent’s Fort on the Santa Fe Trail, was named governor under the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-55d94d7d1bba4d14b84507dd0bfb1a94"><dfn title="55d94d7d1bba4d14b84507dd0bfb1a94">Kearny Code</dfn></a> which went into effect as the legal code for U.S.-occupied New Mexico on September 22, 1846. Governor Bent had a family in Taos with his wife, María Ignacia Jaramillo, an older sister of Josefa Jaramillo, Christopher “Kit” Carson’s wife. Indeed, Bent had informed Kearny that Armijo would be hesitant to fight the Americans if he did not receive reinforcements from Chihuahua or Sonora.

In a tone that inferred his desire to defy the superior Army of the West, Vigil y Alarid pointed out that his people would let officials in Washington D.C. and Mexico City formally decide whether or not they were to become U.S. citizens, as Kearny had proclaimed. Historians Robert J. Rosenbaum and Carlos R. Herrera have argued that Vigil y Alarid chose accommodation as a form of resistance, whereas Armijo decided to withdraw in order to fight another day. Rosenbaum has outlined a continuum of nuevomexicano resistance which ranged from acts of withdrawal, to accommodation and assimilation, to outright armed revolt. Because withdrawal and accommodation can also be considered forms of submission, nuevomexicano resistance to the U.S. occupation tended to be overlooked.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-fe26a6e1f4564379beb684030a0b0e2f">13</a><br/>

Despite Vigil and Otero’s efforts to use their posts to preserve their culture under U.S. rule, most other nuevomexicanos were infuriated by the new government that had not allowed for any type of democratic process. Kearny appointed all of the leaders to their positions and shortly thereafter moved on to aid the war effort in California, with Kit Carson as his guide.<br/>

Most nuevomexicanos in rural areas removed from Santa Fe adopted a form of withdrawal to deal with U.S. rule. They attempted to ignore the new administration and continue with their lives as normally as possible under the circumstances. Almost immediately after Kearny left New Mexico, conditions grew increasingly unsettled. Padre Antonio José Martínez openly opposed the U.S. conquest and he was a target of Governor Bent’s ire due to his opposition to land grants that had been generously given to American traders in the new governor’s social circle.<br/>

The clearest evidence of open nuevomexicano resistance to the American takeover is found in Price’s correspondence and in communications between nuevomexicano rebels and Mexico City officials. In October 1846, for example, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-9ece3f489477402d86c790b96757a80b"><dfn title="9ece3f489477402d86c790b96757a80b">Tomás Ortiz</dfn></a> and Diego de Archuleta outlined their plans for a general uprising to begin on December 19. In an effort to garner more support, they pushed the date back to December 24.

Most of the instigators were arrested, but Ortiz and Archuleta managed to escape and unrest continued. Governor Bent declared the affair resolved in early January, however, and ordered all residents to avoid any future plans for rebellion. Support for armed resistance was widespread; figures like Padre Martínez and Archuleta who represented a sector of the rico elite, combined with mestizos from Taos (including <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-0725fc0267d64527bb1c7fc022d1c8fb"><dfn title="0725fc0267d64527bb1c7fc022d1c8fb">Manuel Cortez</dfn></a> and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-2d38fa24d3b34aafab5af04b239058ca"><dfn title="2d38fa24d3b34aafab5af04b239058ca">Pablo Montoya</dfn></a>), people from Taos Pueblo, and, by the summer of 1847, some Apache bands all joined the armed resistance to U.S. occupation of New Mexico.<br/>

Underestimating the magnitude of the hostilities, Bent traveled to his Taos home to personally address the unrest. On January 19, 1847, a force led by Pablo Montoya, “the self-styled Santa Anna of the north,” and Taos Pueblo headman <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-b2695b4853d04869b311fa5303770d8c"><dfn title="b2695b4853d04869b311fa5303770d8c">Tomasito</dfn></a> killed Bent in his own home in the presence of his wife and children.

Yet revisionists have illustrated that the subsequent actions of those involved in the Taos insurrection indicate that their primary goal was to thwart U.S. control of New Mexico. The day after Bent’s assassination, General <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-2cb2efe77f1e4e8cab11a9291b01d064"><dfn title="2cb2efe77f1e4e8cab11a9291b01d064">Jesús Tafoya</dfn></a> issued a formal declaration of war against the United States on behalf of the Rio Arriba region. That same day Colonel Price also found evidence of a planned insurrection in Rio Abajo. In response, Price moved to head off the Taos rebels with 353 men and four howitzer cannons.<br/>

Despite their superior numbers, they lost the day and Tafoya was counted among the dead. In February, nearly seven-hundred nuevomexicanos again challenged Price at Embudo Pass. This time, they were able to force the Americans to retreat to Taos where Price confronted another rebellion at the Pueblo. After a heated battle, Price’s forces emerged victorious. The best estimates indicate that about two-hundred nuevomexicanos lost their lives in confrontations with Colonel Price during the first two months of 1847. Pablo Montoya was executed following the Battle of Taos, and eight other rebels were convicted of treason and hanged as well. They were tried in the court system established by the Kearny Code, which meant that the jury was dominated by Anglo newcomers. Following the executions, President Polk formally reprimanded Price for his actions. Because the United States and Mexico were still at war, the Taos insurgents should have been treated as prisoners of war, not tried for treason. Despite Kearny’s pronouncement of U.S. citizenship for nuevomexicanos, they could not legally be considered such until the territory was officially incorporated into the nation by the U.S. Congress.<br/>

As violence erupted between the Taos insurgents and Price’s force, Manuel Cortez instigated a guerrilla war from his home in Mora. Reinforcements under the command of Jesse I. Morin arrived in Mora in early February to quell dissension there. From the surrounding mountains, Cortez and his supporters raided Morin’s army rather than attempt to face them in a head-on conflict. After a few weeks of guerrilla fighting, Morin ordered the execution of captured rebels and laid waste to the town of Mora. His forces burned wheat fields in surrounding areas to prevent Cortez’s men from subsisting off of the land. After the annihilation of the town, Morin led his men back to Santa Fe.<br/>

Their raids on U.S. camps inspired retaliation against nuevomexicano villages which frequently resulted in the deaths of civilians. Such actions further solidified anti-American sentiment in the region and sharpened Cortez’s resolve. By August 1847 U.S. military officials far from New Mexico declared that the conflict was over, but Colonel Price knew better. He learned that Cortez had received a commission from the Mexican government to continue the struggle and that a large army was taking shape in Chihuahua for the purpose of moving against Santa Fe. Although war preparations in both Chihuahua and Durango continued for the next few months, such efforts came to naught when U.S. and Mexican officials signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in February of 1848.<br/>

Kearny’s keen diplomacy did allow for the bloodless occupation of Santa Fe in August 1846, but that single event did not mean that nuevomexicanos were willing to accept conquest without a fight. Even after the ratification of the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-bcc7a0b5cf714c0fb8d6799ec0981e65"><dfn title="bcc7a0b5cf714c0fb8d6799ec0981e65">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</dfn></a>, nuevomexicanos, Pueblo peoples, Apaches, and Comanches persisted in their struggle to maintain their cultures and identities as residents of a U.S. territory.<br/>

Although Mexican forces were able to win some important battles, the devastation wrought by the War of a Thousand Deserts played a major role in preventing them from turning the tide in the overall war effort. U.S. military and political officials debated different means of forcing the Mexican government to capitulate. Initially, they hoped that victories throughout the Mexican north would be sufficient to force negotiations in Mexico City. Even after California was captured in the fall of 1846 and the vital ports of Tampico and Veracruz fell under U.S. control, the Mexican people were unwilling to concede defeat. Any politician who attempted to negotiate would have appeared weak and unpatriotic.<br/>

Although Mexican military and political officials faced opposition and defeat on all sides, they continued to hold out. By early 1847, General <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-09a188bd0be04427b35d821e9a87f480"><dfn title="09a188bd0be04427b35d821e9a87f480">Winfield Scott</dfn></a> led 14,000 men from the port city of Veracruz in a campaign to capture Mexico City.

Ocampo said, “give the people arms and they will defend themselves.” At the same time, peasant rebellions broke out across Mexico alongside continued resistance against U.S. troops.

As historian Leticia Reina summarized the issue: “The Mexican government preferred coming to terms with the United States rather than endanger the interests of the ruling class.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-cba60d9d9af340ba8520f1242114c3b8">14</a><br/>

The treaty itself was the result of tense negotiations between American representative Nicholas Trist and Bernardo Couto, Miguel Atristain, and Luís Gonzaga Cuevas who were members of a special commission to represent Mexico’s interim government which had formed at Querétaro. Although President Polk pushed Trist at the eleventh hour to negotiate for all of Mexico’s territory and even attempted to recall him, the negotiations had already been completed and the document signed on February 2, 1848.

The Mexican commission’s original draft included clearer phrasing that specified all Mexicans to be treated as the equals of other American citizens at all times, but those stipulations were omitted by the U.S. Congress during the ratification process. Article X directly addressed Spanish and Mexican land grants in the ceded territories. It stipulated that all such grants remain intact as outlined by Spanish or Mexican law. The U.S. Congress, however, struck Article X from the treaty as one of the terms of ratification.<br/>

            <figcaption>In his capacity as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Clifford addressed Mexican officials' questions about the ratifications made to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo by the U.S. Congress. In the Querétaro Protocol, Clifford assured Mexican policymakers that that alterations in no way minimized the rights of former Mexican citizens in the ceded territories. Mexican officials were not so sure.<br/>

Ratification passed by the narrowest of margins: it was approved by one vote. A memorandum of understanding, titled the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-1852457effd3489696288e385fc1a5b1"><dfn title="1852457effd3489696288e385fc1a5b1">Querétaro Protocol</dfn></a>, arranged between Clifford and Mexican negotiators convinced many Mexican legislators that the interests of their fellow citizens in the ceded territories would be guaranteed despite the changes to the treaty. Others were not so sure. Ultimately, after the crushing defeat in the war, Mexican policymakers believed that they were in no position to challenge the treaty. As the detractors had feared, American officials ignored the Quéretaro Protocol once official dealings concluded.<br/>
