The independent Texas Republic had hoped for annexation to the United States that was not forthcoming, and its officials also sought to make the claim that their territory stretched to the Rio Grande (called the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-9c3aa43db2de42c0815318f7acc14a1c"><dfn title="9c3aa43db2de42c0815318f7acc14a1c">Rio Bravo del Norte</dfn></a> in Mexico). According to the most audacious claim (later asserted by the Polk administration following U.S. annexation), Texas not only included lands along the southern section of the Rio Grande but stretched northward to the river’s headwaters.<br/>

Of course, nuevomexicanos and other Mexicans contested and dismissed the Texans’ territorial pursuits. Despite the secret <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f415b567193a470da435b51628395e7d"><dfn title="f415b567193a470da435b51628395e7d">Treaty of Velasco</dfn></a> signed by Santa Anna after the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836, the Mexican government never recognized Texas as an independent republic. Instead, they considered it a province in rebellion. Economic complications, political infighting, and the need to fend off British and French incursions to force the payment of debts, meant that Mexican forces were never able to attempt a military reconquest. Officially, the Mexican government held that the Nueces River was the actual southern boundary of Texas. </p>

Lamar</dfn></a> sidestepped the Texas Congress and commissioned a group of 270 men to travel to Santa Fe in the summer of 1841. Ostensibly, their mission was to establish trade connections.

A former secretary to General Sam Houston and one of the expeditionaries, Peter Gallagher, summarized the group’s purpose: “This ‘wild goose chase’ was sponsored by President Lamar for the express purpose of territorial expansion, of acquiring control of New Mexico—by peaceful means if possible; by military force if necessary.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-6f59702f7e704cfcaf4569309def7110">1</a><br/>

Due to scarcity of water and food, they plotted a circuitous route along the Brazos River, into the center of Comanche territory, westward across the Llano Estacado, and along the Red River. As they slowly attempted to traverse the 1,300-mile route, sweltering temperatures, aggravated by meager supplies, caused intense suffering. By the time they reached the Red River, they had shed most of their carts and baggage in an effort to more easily pass through thick woodlands and deep gorges.<br/>

On September 17, the New Mexican force located the Texans and saved them from certain death.

He had correctly characterized the group as an invasion force when he ordered Archuleta’s party to intercept it. At one point, he threatened to execute every member of the Texan expedition, but eventually the governor decided to hold them prisoner and transport them southward to Ciudad Chihuahua and then on to Mexico City. Along the way, many of them lost their lives. Those who were unable to walk of their own accord met execution. Others died under the harsh conditions of their long march to the Mexican capital. All along the way, compassionate locals provided the suffering Texans with water and food when possible.<br/>

In early November of 1841, Armijo distributed a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-9d5c158ce6ff4616b7784650239be7f8"><dfn title="9d5c158ce6ff4616b7784650239be7f8">broadside</dfn></a> throughout New Mexico to clarify and justify his actions.

Combined with reports like Kendall’s, the critiques of his countrymen helped to weaken his strong reputation for Mexican patriotism. Especially damaging was Padre Martínez’s vocal complaint that Armijo had handed the territory over to Americans. Between 1837 and 1846, the governor granted about 16 million acres of land. The year of his successful handling of the Texan-Santa Fe Expedition, he approved the massive <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-27a99f1df9e34056b6fd0f216a36135f"><dfn title="27a99f1df9e34056b6fd0f216a36135f">Maxwell Land Grant</dfn></a>.

Despite differences in economic standing, however, most nuevomexicanos resisted American occupation in one way or another.<br/>
