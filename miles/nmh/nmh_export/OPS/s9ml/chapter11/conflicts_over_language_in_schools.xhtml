Among the banners held up at the July 4 procession in Las Vegas was one that read, “Free schools for our children.” Although researchers have translated slogans such as this one into English, we must remember that the actual signs held up that day contained messages in Spanish. </p>

The same was true of Pueblo and Navajo parents. In striking contrast to the situation for Anglo Americans during the same time frame, New Mexican parents faced the troubling question of whether or not <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ed416/ae4.html">compulsory education programs</a> would challenge, and even possibly destroy, their cultural traditions. Language was a central component of indigenous and nuevomexicano cultures.<br/>

Public debates about what languages would be allowed for use in New Mexico’s schools focused on Spanish and English. Many Navajos and Pueblos spoke either English or Spanish by the late nineteenth century. Yet they also continued to preserve their own languages as a means of maintaining their cultural identities in the face of colonization efforts that had been at play in one form or another for almost three centuries.<br/>

The Treaty of 1868 included provisions for compulsory education for their children. Despite the support of some headmen, such as Manuelito, most Navajos ignored the sections of the treaty dealing with education. Based on his commitment to education in the English language and reluctant embrace of Anglo-American ideals, Manuelito sent all three of his sons to the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Tragically, all three of them died in connection to their travels to and from the school.<br/>

During the 1925 academic year, for example, only 35% of Navajo children were enrolled in school. The percentage further declined by 1948 when just 25% of eligible students enrolled in classes.<br/>

In contrast to the great distances traveled by Navajo children to reach boarding schools far from their family homes in the Dinétah, however, Pueblo students generally attended schools that were much closer to home. Several schools were established on Pueblo lands, such as the one at Santa Clara Pueblo, and the Albuquerque and Santa Fe Indian Schools were relatively close to New Mexico’s nineteen Pueblo communities.<br/>

As historian Margaret Connell Szasz has argued, the experiences of Native American children in boarding school settings were strikingly similar across time and space. The case of a five-year-old San Juan Pueblo girl is illustrative of the humiliation that most students endured. On her first day at the Santa Fe Indian School, the principal indicated a clock on the wall and asked her to tell other students the time. As she recounted, “I just looked at it and I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to tell time, so I just covered my face [with my shawl] and the students laughed.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-d4cf7f9233454fb49978cfe254f4709a">15</a><br/>

As Captain Richard H. Pratt, founder of the infamous<a href="http://home.epix.net/~landis/"> Carlisle Indian School</a> in Pennsylvania, stated, the goal of boarding schools was to “<a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4929/">kill the Indian and save the man</a>.” Pratt meant that indigenous peoples should assimilate to white American ways of dressing, speaking, thinking, and acting. In so doing, they were to completely set aside their former traditions, ideals, and languages. Boarding schools were intended as workshops of assimilation.<br/>

Mortification, such as that experienced by the young San Juan Pueblo girl, stemmed not only from ignorance of white American ways of doing things. Pueblo children were<a href="http://www.whitewolfpack.com/2013/08/elders-talk-about-significance-of-long.html"> forced to cut their long hair</a>, dress in modern styles of clothing worn by white children, answer to new names, and, at times, to participate in drills reminiscent of military routines. They were expressly forbidden to speak their native languages, typically at the risk of corporal punishment.</p>

Suzy Marmon of Laguna Pueblo, for example, attended both the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-db06d002ca3c4bcd872780698d7df381"><dfn title="db06d002ca3c4bcd872780698d7df381">Menaul School</dfn></a> in Albuquerque (where her indigenous name was changed to Suzy) and Carlisle. After completing her education in the boarding school system, she worked as a teacher at Isleta Pueblo and then in her own community, “because I felt it was my duty to help my people if I could.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-be1118512b8c4dbc90d440ffdaef32f4">16</a><br/>

The use of Pueblo and Navajo languages was not an option in school settings, and many former students failed to pass along their knowledge of their native language to their children. The eradication of indigenous languages was never up for public debate, in contrast with the use of Spanish in educational settings. Spanish-language usage in New Mexican schools was a point of contention in the years leading up to and following the turn of the twentieth century. The drive to protect the use of Spanish in primary education united nuevomexicanos that had opposed one another in the struggle for social and economic justice led by Las Gorras Blancas, Los Caballeros del Trabajo, and el Partido del Pueblo Unido.<br/>

First, they focused on the beauty of Spanish speech and prose. According to Chaves, Spanish was a “highly important, interesting and sonorous language, and that our territorial institutions should require their graduates to attend a complete course of the same.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-950db0bda5874cf2ba1ee8f5ac9a56cc">17</a> Much of the Spanish-language press throughout New Mexico supported his arguments with their regular installments of poetry and stories that reflected the elegance of Spanish prose and also helped to preserve local histories and folklore.<br/>

As Chaves also noted, “it is a crime against nature and humanity to try and rob the children of New Mexico of this right, their natural advantage, of the language which is theirs by birthright, to deprive them unjustly of the advantages, great and numerous, which those have who command two languages.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-283330b3eead44d5a70af50f8036af21">18</a><br/>

C. de Baca refuted claims that Spanish usage disqualified nuevomexicanos from citizenship with the idea that New Mexico was unique due to the necessity of bilingualism. He asserted that, “the arguments and declamations of theorists concerning the patriotism manifested by an exclusive use of the English language have little weight when placed beside the fact that a busy world is making an urgent and increasing demand for more young men and young women competent to use fluently both English and Spanish.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-daad985dbcb748f881970cfcd58d4eeb">19</a><br/>

The department’s focus was decidedly different, illustrating the reality that the battle for language usage in the classroom was drawn along ethnic lines. Hadley and his supporters deemphasized the validity of the Spanish language for New Mexican students and offered a line of reasoning paralleling the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-6c65182d343e499ca8c0c44def1db114"><dfn title="6c65182d343e499ca8c0c44def1db114">Progressive Era</dfn></a> school of thought.

In the end, through creative writing of the state constitution and careful readings of national-level legislation, nuevomexicano politicians ensured the presence of Spanish in the new state’s primary classrooms. It bears repeating that the concerns of Pueblo and Navajo parents for the preservation of their own languages and traditions were not considered at either the territorial (then state after 1912) or national levels.<br/>

It read: “[the] ability to read, write, speak, and understand English sufficiently without the aid of an interpreter shall be a necessary qualification for all State officers and members of the State legislature.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-84aa4ec6118a4145a209e10290fac93b">20</a> The article did not preclude Spanish in the classroom, but it did threaten to limit political participation to only those who spoke English.<br/>

As <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-6bcfb48ad73940c09516ee18e0c85d7a"><dfn title="6bcfb48ad73940c09516ee18e0c85d7a">Aurora Lucero</dfn></a> wrote in the <i>Santa Fe Daily New Mexican</i>, the idea held by most Anglo Americans in Congress was that nuevomexicanos’ continued use of Spanish illustrated that they were ill-prepared for citizenship. On the contrary, she argued, “the Spanish-Americans of New Mexico have never been bad citizens. They have more than once proved their loyalty to the government and their love for the ‘Stars and Stripes,’ as their conduct in the Civil and Spanish-American wars, and in many of the Indian wars, abundantly testifies.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-7528504532d54345b0348e5ae0e66a88">21</a><br/>

In this regard, nuevomexicano legislators scored a victory. Their article was in effect for twenty years, then renewed in 1931 and again in 1943. Eventually, the provision dropped from the state constitution because the English language became so pervasive by the mid-twentieth century.<br/>

Hearkening back to the promises of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, they asserted that nuevomexicanos had been guaranteed full citizenship rights in the U.S. nation—a provision that included the right to vote.<br/>

In so doing, however, they drafted vague legislation akin to the final wording of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In creating a relatively vague education provision, nuevomexicano lawmakers “meant to create a space, albeit an ambiguous one, for the inclusion of Spanish in the classroom[.]”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-e338f88b067c45bfad3bd28ae5f84553">23</a> They understood the harsh reality that many Eastern politicians would not support New Mexico’s statehood unless the English-only educational statue remained in place.<br/>

They did not want to do anything that might prevent statehood—especially after Congress had approved an Enabling Act for the first time—so they had few other options besides political slight-of-hand. In Article 12, section 8, of<a href="http://www.newmexicohistory.org/centennial/documents/NMConstitution.pdf"> New Mexico’s state constitution</a>, ambiguous language allowed for Spanish-language instruction in classrooms where the texts were written in English. That article read:<br/>

Due to the economic importance of the canal, some Eastern-U.S. lawmakers echoed earlier nuevomexicano arguments about the utility of the Spanish language. Some argued that Spanish should be studied by U.S. students in order to prepare them for business relations with Latin American nations afforded by the canal.<br/>

Congressmen made a strong distinction between the idea of native-English speakers taking classes in Spanish and native-Spanish speakers continuing to receive instruction in their native language. The result was the continued categorization of Spanish as a foreign language.<br/>

Elites who adopted the Spanish-American Ethnic Identity argued that Spanish was on par with English due to its roots as a language of European conquerors. Poorer nuevomexicanos also benefitted from such claims because their children were also able to receive instruction in Spanish in their classrooms.<br/>

Despite the important gains achieved through the push for Spanish-language instruction in New Mexico’s schools, deeper issues of colonialism and poverty were not addressed. Most nuevomexicanos remained impoverished and the cultural legacies of indigenous peoples were given no attention at the political and legal levels. Anglo politicians viewed Spanish-speaking New Mexicans as inferior to themselves, while those who spoke Spanish continued to tout their superiority to indigenous peoples. Such was—and is—an unfortunate consequence of New Mexico’s legacy of multiple conquests.<br/>
