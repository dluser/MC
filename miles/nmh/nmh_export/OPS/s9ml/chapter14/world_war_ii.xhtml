American involvement in World War II brought an unprecedented level of spending and technological development that finally pulled the nation out of the depression. </p>

New Deal programs alleviated families’ immediate suffering but they did not rejuvenate the economy to the point that it was able to function without subsidies. The New Deal initiated a process of increasing federal intervention in New Mexico and throughout the Western United States. During World War II, the federal presence in the West shifted from economic relief to the fortification of the military-industrial complex.</p>

Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps based on the unfounded suspicion that they supported the Japanese war effort. In all, about 112,000 people of Japanese descent were interned; nearly two-thirds were Nisei, or second-generation Americans, and the other one-third were Issei, or first-generation Americans. Nisei had been born in the United States and enjoyed American citizenship. </p>

Families were forced to sell their homes, possessions, and businesses for pennies on the dollar. They were loaded onto busses and transported to makeshift facilities, which included converted animal stalls, before receiving an assignment to a specific <a href="http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-5302-historys-lessons.html">internment camp</a>, most of which were located in remote locations around the Western United States.</p>

Government officials used terms like “internment” and “evacuation” to suggest the legality of the action and to imply that the “relocation” of Japanese Americans was for their own good—to protect their safety. Many scholars now prefer to use the term “imprisonment” to emphasize the injustice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s<a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5154"> Executive Order</a> 9066. Not until 1983 did a Congressional Committee recognize that the mass removal of Japanese Americans from their homes was not a “military necessity,” as had been argued at the time. Instead, the committee attributed the imprisonment to “race war, mass hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-4bd9f9b6139942d18e6a842da29e78fb">9</a> For most survivors of internment, however, federal attempts to recuperate their personal losses were too little, too late.<br/>

Less well known were the internment facilities located near Santa Fe and Lordsburg, in the southwestern corner of the state. Italians and Germans suspected of disloyalty to the United States were imprisoned at the New Mexico facilities, along with Japanese American prisoners. At the Santa Fe camp, 4,555 men of Japanese heritage were imprisoned between March 1942 and April 1946. Far fewer Japanese Americans were sent to the Lordsburg facility, which primarily functioned as a camp for prisoners of war.<br/>

The others were allowed to join their families in internment camps in other areas of the Southwest. The camps in New Mexico, then, were reserved for those who the federal government deemed to be a direct threat to the security of the United States. Other Japanese American prisoners later entered the camp between 1943 and 1945. The last group was released in April 1946.<br/>

Although not publicly known at the time, Navajos created an unbreakable code using their own language that facilitated communications and intelligence gathering.

In 1940, prior to U.S. entry into the Second World War, the War Department approached the Bureau of Indian Affairs about the possibility of recruiting Native Americans for service in the Signal Corps. The Army program was somewhat small in scale. About fifty Comanche men served in the 4th Signal Company, but their services were only used sporadically.

Unlike African American soldiers who served in segregated units, Navajo marines (and all Native American servicemen) were integrated into existing units. Still, some Marines initially mistook them for Japanese soldiers. In one case, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-74a32660f4854144bd7cb4fdd43b0076"><dfn title="74a32660f4854144bd7cb4fdd43b0076">William McCabe</dfn></a> was detained by a sentry when attempting to eat with other members of his platoon. The provost marshal nearly ordered him shot, but finally realized that he was indeed an American citizen. After a few such experiences, bodyguards were assigned to the Code Talkers. They were ordered “to never leave their sides.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-4d01dc462b1a4d738f27ff42607d2f92">11</a><br/>

During World War II, however, the Navajo Code Talkers boasted the only unbroken communications system in the Pacific theater. Their efforts greatly aided the war effort, but they were not recognized for their service for over a quarter-century. Security measures remained in place to ensure that the Navajo code would not become public knowledge.<br/>

By the close of the war, 420 Navajo men had been trained by the Marines as Code Talkers. Upon returning home, many suffered the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in silence because they were unable to share the details of their wartime missions with family or friends. Ritual dances, such as the <a href="http://www.manataka.org/page1671.html">Nidaa’ or Enemy Way Ceremony</a>, helped some to overcome their strife.<br/>

Despite equal treatment during their tenure in the Marines, members of the Navajo Nation were prohibited from voting in either Arizona or New Mexico and the continued restrictions on grazing meant that veterans were unable to reestablish their former herds.<br/>

Like so many of his people, he received harsh treatment in boarding schools when he was younger. He recalled being chained to an iron pipe for an entire week as punishment for speaking his native language. During World War II, that language was the basis of the unbreakable code devised by Navajo servicemen.<br/>

They led Diné efforts to address economic, political, and social inequity. Several, including <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-7202d9355c884bceaa594b9bbc854f3e"><dfn title="7202d9355c884bceaa594b9bbc854f3e">Carl Gorman</dfn></a>, obtained advanced degrees. They also supported lawsuits against the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the states of New Mexico and Arizona, and local municipalities, to gain rights they were denied. By the mid-1950s, Navajos had asserted their right to vote in all elections, from the local to the federal level.<br/>

Despite the continuation of secrecy measures at higher levels of the military, for the first time their crucial contribution to the war effort became public knowledge. Over the next two decades, oral history projects and official ceremonies publicized the Code Talkers’ service. In 1981, for example, the Marines formed another Navajo platoon with twenty-nine members in honor of the original group of Code Talkers. The following year, Congress declared August 14 to be National Navajo Code Talkers Day. In 1993 an exhibit to honor the Code Talkers opened at the Pentagon.<br/>

A few of the Code Talkers who belonged to subsequent recruitment cycles are still alive, and they receive public honors from time-to-time, like those discussed by David Patterson in his video interview.<br/>
