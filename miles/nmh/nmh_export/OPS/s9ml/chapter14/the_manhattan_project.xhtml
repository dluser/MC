At first glance, New Mexico seems an unlikely place to house the project that successfully created the first atomic weapons. Prior to the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943, the state had almost no scientific infrastructure besides limited laboratory space at the University of New Mexico. As the decade of the 1940s began, New Mexico remained primarily rural. Residents were just as likely to see people traveling by horses and wagons as by automobiles in regions outside of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. </p>

Since the early Spanish-colonial period, through the Mexican period, and into the U.S. territorial period, the military played a central role in New Mexican society. During World War II, the U.S. military increased its presence in the state in a clandestine way. New Mexico’s isolation from national urban centers was the basis of its appeal.<br/>

In 1938 German and Swedish scientists discovered<a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Introduction/Physics-of-Nuclear-Energy/"> fission</a>—the ability to split a uranium atom.  The next year, on January 27, 1939,<a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-50e9eec12aa543579d3171af36bed5c4"><dfn title="50e9eec12aa543579d3171af36bed5c4"> Niels Bohr</dfn></a> announced their findings at a physics conference held at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Following the conference, physicists throughout the world replicated uranium fission. Their work suggested that an awesome source of energy from the atom was now available to humankind. Early scientific estimates indicated that uranium 235 could potentially produce as much energy as fifteen tons of TNT.<br/>

Scientists also realized that much work was yet to be done in order to produce a self-sustaining fission chain reaction. In other words, the early experiments proved that a single uranium atom could be split. To realize the energy potential of fission, multiple atoms would need to split in succession. For atomic scientists around the world, the next step was to produce a fission chain reaction.<br/>

Some of those that composed the exodus known as the “Brain Drain” were Jewish, and others realized that Nazis had little patience for anyone who might challenge their program of German expansion and ethnic cleansing. Nazi officials were highly suspicious of professors due to the critical nature of academic work.<br/>

By that time, Einstein and a few other European scientists had earned international renown for their work. Teller considered scientific knowledge of fission among scientists who remained in Nazi Germany to be one of the most troubling threats that humankind had yet faced, as did his associates Leo Szilard and Eugene P. Wigner. The trio convinced Einstein <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Einstein-Roosevelt-letter.png">send a letter</a> to President <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-3c1a47393fd44b879b7b5a57878ce99e"><dfn title="3c1a47393fd44b879b7b5a57878ce99e">Franklin D.

Prior to that time, the U.S. federal government had shown little interest in the development of fission. In stark contrast to Europe where theoretical physicists were popular figures and where scientific work was closely monitored by national governments, scientific experimentation in the United States transpired in the seclusion of universities that had looser connections to the federal government.<br/>

The commission united politicians and scientists to study the issue in the context of the brewing European conflict. Based on their findings, the committee concluded that uranium fission would not have an important impact on the war effort. As of yet, no breakthrough had been made on the question of creating a <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/first-hand-recollections-first-self-sustaining-chain-reaction">sustained nuclear chain reaction</a> and, based on the current state of experiments in progress, one did not seem to be forthcoming.<br/>

They understood more clearly the potential for uranium fission to create a horribly destructive weapon, and they began to work in U.S. universities in an effort to produce a nuclear chain reaction before German scientists could do so. Physicists in the United States agreed to suspend the publication of their findings in order to prevent advances in their research from benefiting scientists in Nazi Germany.<br/>

He oversaw the construction of the Pentagon. The atomic program presented a number of unique challenges, not least of which was the requirement of complete secrecy. To maintain security, Groves made the decision to compartmentalize the physicists’ and engineers’ assignments. This meant that small teams of scientists worked on specific pieces of the puzzle in isolation from one another. No single group possessed complete knowledge of all facets of the project. Compartmentalization allowed Groves to include British allies in the work as well.<br/>

In an extension of his compartmentalized approach, Groves harnessed U.S. manufacturing and technological industries and American labor to further the work. He secured the cooperation of the General Electric, Kodak, Chrysler, and DuPont corporations, among others. Along with producing the tools and equipment that the project required, those companies helped to construct facilities to refine uranium-235 and plutonium at Oak Ridge and Hanford.</p>

He studied there for a time without matriculating, but just three weeks after enrolling he received his Ph.D. He was only twenty-four years old at the time.
