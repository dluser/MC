They were uncertain whether their design would detonate, and they did not fully understand what the consequences of a nuclear explosion would be. <span>	</span></p>
        <p id="data-uuid-4966865a26eb446eb872a355ef954a03" data-uuid="4966865a26eb446eb872a355ef954a03">Two different types of atomic weapons were created at Los Alamos; one used uranium and the other used plutonium. The scientists were most concerned about the detonation of the plutonium bomb because the “gun method” that they used with the uranium device would not work with plutonium. As an alternative, they developed an implosion method in which the plutonium was to be surrounded with explosives (TNT); the explosion of the TNT would theoretically compress the plutonium and ignite the nuclear chain reaction. Although they were certain the gun method would work with uranium, they were less sure about the implosion method.<br/>

Oppenheimer and <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-16a1619c959e4442bbe9cc7369a40f9e"><dfn title="16a1619c959e4442bbe9cc7369a40f9e">George B. Kistiakowsky</dfn></a>, an explosives expert at Harvard, argued that the test was necessary but General Groves opposed the idea. His main concern was that if the test failed to produce a nuclear explosion, plutonium would be strewn across the desert.<br/>

        <p id="data-uuid-901b6818874e4fd0868bf5e884183d9d" data-uuid="901b6818874e4fd0868bf5e884183d9d">Facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, had been established to produce the fissionable uranium isotope, U-235, and plutonium for the work at Los Alamos. U-235 is rare, however, and in 1940 scientists estimated that they would need twelve million years to extract a pound of the isotope from naturally occurring uranium. As an alternative, plutonium was created by bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons through a complex process.<br/>

Following the war, General Groves spoke of the teams at Oak Ridge and Hanford in the highest terms due to their ability to develop new techniques for the extraction of U-235 and the generation of plutonium. The result was the production of several pounds of each in just a few years during the war.<br/>

In the end, Oppenheimer convinced the general to approve a field test by proposing the construction of an enormous, 214-ton tank that the team called “Jumbo” to contain the plutonium if the blast failed. If the test was successful, on the other hand, Jumbo would be incinerated.<br/>

Located in southern New Mexico’s Jornada del Muerto, the site is often associated with the town of Alamogordo which is about sixty miles distant. Socorro was the nearest population center of consequence, about thirty miles to the north. The land itself had belonged to the state of New Mexico and been leased to ranchers for grazing. When the United States entered the war, the military took control of the area.<br/>

Historian Marjorie Bell Chambers was the first to attribute the name to Oppenheimer’s study of Hindu belief.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-9e5ceb2349c74a0f9521e68a8b0094ec">16</a> As historian Ferenc Szasz later explained, “the Hindu concept of Trinity consists of Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; and Shiva, the Destroyer. For Hindus, whatever exists in the universe is never destroyed. It is simply transformed.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-445b21b5896849e6b9f4c32c390c49c1">17</a> Given that Oppenheimer’s team produced the most destructive weapon yet known to humankind, the idea that nothing is truly destroyed might have offered some comfort.<br/>

Among the most troubling was that the physicists were not sure whether or not an atomic explosion would ignite the earth’s atmosphere. As construction of the Trinity site proceeded in early 1945, the question was nothing new. As early as the summer of 1942 Edward Teller’s calculations suggested that the bomb could create enough heat to cause the atmosphere to flare. The result would be the eradication of all life on earth.<br/>

        <p id="data-uuid-8eea040efc1a4c2eb61070ade4277da4" data-uuid="8eea040efc1a4c2eb61070ade4277da4">Oppenheimer was deeply troubled by Teller’s findings, and he interrupted Arthur H. Compton, head of the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, for a second opinion while he was vacationing with his family in Michigan. The pair conversed for long hours on the banks of Oswego Lake. Ultimately, Compton concluded that if calculations “showed that the chances of igniting the atmosphere were more than approximately three in one million . . . he would not proceed with the Manhattan Project.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-cecb0c6cda2642299152f583b7a995bf">18</a><br/>

Teller revised his initial figures to account for the presence of cooler air that would occur near the explosion itself, but as late as the fall of 1944 the question had yet to be settled to anyone’s satisfaction. Ultimately, Hans Bethe, head of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, calculated that the Trinity test explosion would not ignite the atmosphere. His figures seemed to account for all variables, and, as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-e278e2495cdf42008f9a01a468e069bb"><dfn title="e278e2495cdf42008f9a01a468e069bb">Kenneth Bainbridge </dfn></a>recalled, “We all put our faith in Bethe.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-6abfa65c182446f99cfa16acc05bc94a">19</a> An added comfort was that Teller’s revised calculations jibed with those of Bethe.<br/>

They were not completely sure whether or not the blast would set off earthquakes, although their calculations suggested that the probability of tremors was low. Additionally, they did not fully comprehend the nature of nuclear fallout until years after the Trinity test and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br/>

Among the ideal weather conditions for the test were visibility greater than forty-five miles, humidity less than eighty-five percent, stable temperature lapse rate, little to no atmospheric inversion, and light winds to the northeast. With winds to the northeast, fallout would travel over the most sparsely populated ranch lands and avoid populated areas like Socorro, Alamogordo, Las Cruces, or El Paso. During the summer months, thunderstorms would be the major weather concern.<br/>

His job was perhaps one of the most stressful. Given the paucity of weather records for the Jornada del Muerto, his task of predicting when the ideal conditions would occur was quite difficult. He successfully forecasted the date of May 7, 1945, for the “100 Ton Shot,” a preliminary test detonation of TNT to help calibrate the instruments at the Trinity site. In June, he made a long-range forecast for the summer that indicated July 18-21 as the best weather window. July 12-14 would be the second best chance for ideal conditions.<br/>

International politics intervened following Germany’s surrender in May of 1945. President Roosevelt had died on April 12, and his vice president, <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-877218ab23234647b375a66902ae3a4f"><dfn title="877218ab23234647b375a66902ae3a4f">Harry S. Truman</dfn></a> became the leader of the United States.

He believed that news of a successful atomic test would provide the upper hand in negotiations between the “Big Three” regarding the shape of the postwar world. Under pressure from above, Groves set July 16 as the date for the test.<br/>

On the evening of July 15 he predicted light, variable west-to-southwest winds for the next morning. Violent thunderstorms developed in the area overnight. At 2 a.m., Hubbard advised the team to postpone the test by one hour; he predicted that, by that time, the winds would change and the storms would dissipate.<br/>

They had changed direction as Hubbard had predicted. The blast exceeded all expectations. By several reports, it lit up the entire area like the sun. Heat at its core was comparable to that of the center of the sun, and the fireball created a half-mile crater. People in at least three states saw the light from the explosion, which projected a mushroom cloud 38,000 feet into the atmosphere. Every living thing was destroyed within a mile radius.<br/>

Enrico Fermi experienced the explosion from 10,000 feet away. Just before the bomb ignited, he tore up a piece of paper. Immediately <a href="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Maps/TrinityMap.shtml">after the explosion</a>, he let go of the papers to see how far the blast wave carried them. Based on his calculations, the bomb’s force was equal to about 10,000 tons of TNT.<br/>

Santa Fe Railroad engineer Ed Lane was on a train near Belen that morning, and he later commented that “he had a front seat for the greatest fireworks show he had ever witnessed.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-f000426782f54dab9594c59d0bee1462">20</a><br/>

The cliché that “hindsight is twenty-twenty” seems to fit subsequent debates about nuclear weapons. Those involved in the conversation at the time had no such luxury. Some argued that the U.S. military should not use the atomic bomb because to do so would open Pandora’s Box—all other nations would race to create the same destructive technology.<br/>

Some argued that the use of the atomic bomb would not only end the war against Japan, it would also intimidate Stalin and the Soviet Union. The wartime alliance between the United States and the Soviets was strained at best; the end of the war led to increased polarization as Truman and Stalin each made opposition to the other nation a specific, nationalist goal.<br/>

One of the other lines of reasoning in support of using the bomb centered on the idea that to do so would preserve the lives of American soldiers. Revisionist historians after 1945 painted Truman as something of a villain regarding the use of atomic weapons at the close of the war. By taking that action, they asserted, he appeased those who wanted to project strength to the Soviets and he simultaneously used the lives of U.S. servicemen and women for political ends.<br/>

Nimitz argued that the U.S. military did not need to open Pandora’s Box through the use of nuclear weapons. And, after the fact, Marshall publicly declared that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki only shortened the war by a few months at most.<br/>

In <i>The Day the Sun Rose Twice</i>, historian Ferenc Szasz placed Truman’s decision in its political and social context. He emphasized the enormous pressure placed on the president to save U.S. lives and end the war at the earliest date possible. Additionally, scientists, politicians, and military officials did not fully recognize the potential ramifications of the use of atomic weapons in 1945. Teams from Los Alamos and certain U.S. and European universities traveled to Trinity, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, to study the effects of the devastating explosions and fallout.<br/>

Szasz argues for a middle-ground interpretation of events based on “the simple question of momentum of the Manhattan Project.” Oppenheimer once remarked that “the decision [to drop the bombs] was implicit in the project.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-747ec73bcb614566899135882184315a">22</a> Several of the physicists involved in the project were deeply conflicted as they witnessed the Trinity test because they knew that the intention had always been to use atomic bombs in combat.<br/>

Only three weeks after the Trinity test, on<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0806.html"> August 6, 1945</a>, the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, a city of about 320,000 people at the time. Between 70,000 and 80,000 were killed instantly and another 100,000 or so died over the next few years due to burns and radioactive fallout.<br/>

With an estimated population of just over 260,000 people, casualties there were even more extensive than had been the case at Hiroshima. In central Hiroshima, the mortality rate per square mile was 15,000; in Nagasaki 20,000. By comparison, the firebombing of Tokyo in March of 1945 caused a casualty rate of 5,300 people per square mile.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-e4084319aa284ce692edb9c80a53e127">23</a> The initial number of casualties in Nagasaki numbered about 100,000.<br/>
