Gálvez’s actions prevented the British from taking control of the river’s vital transportation and communication channels, and played an important role in the patriots’ eventual victory.

The Spanish Empire, already the most extensive in modern history, was at its largest in terms of overall territory. Land did not necessarily equal power, however. Residents of the brand-new United States looked westward across the Appalachian Mountains with an eye to expansion.

            <figcaption><b>Proclamation Line </b>Following the French and Indian War (known as the Seven Years' War in Europe), British King George III issued a Royal Proclamation in 1763 that established a hard boundary that British colonists were forbidden to cross for the purposes of settlement. Due to the colonists' expansionist ambitions, they considered the Proclamation of 1763 an unjust imposition by a faraway King.

Further complicating matters, the Bourbon Reforms created as many problems as they solved. For example, attempts to reform political posts in the Spanish Americas pitted recently arrived appointees from Spain itself (called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-4957660847274a9da2b3a5729a1139d7"><dfn title="4957660847274a9da2b3a5729a1139d7"><i>peninsulares</i></dfn></a>) against people of Spanish heritage who had been born and raised in the colonies (called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-a85906d9250d4f6f918938f2d925b00a"><dfn title="a85906d9250d4f6f918938f2d925b00a"><i>criollos</i></dfn></a>).

In 1800 he negotiated the secret <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-0bda3dde65534da3abd13b29dcd76af9"><dfn title="0bda3dde65534da3abd13b29dcd76af9">Treaty of San Ildefonso</dfn></a> that returned Louisiana to France in exchange for an Italian duchy and the promise never to sell the territory to a third party. Although Spanish officials balked, Napoleon’s meteoric rise in power over European affairs left them little choice. The French emperor considered Louisiana a springboard to regain North American colonies. Before that dream could become a reality, however, French forces would have to quell the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-99291a5a6dab47b9a6f42803709caf16"><dfn title="99291a5a6dab47b9a6f42803709caf16">slave revolution</dfn></a> that was raging in Saint Domingue (today Haiti). At the same time, President Thomas Jefferson hoped to negotiate rights to the port of New Orleans. Yellow fever and a string of defeats convinced Napoleon to cut French losses in the Americas just as U.S. envoys approached his government in 1803. Hoping only for navigation and trade privileges, they received much more than they had bargained for when Napoleon sold them all of Louisiana for $15 million in the transaction that became known as the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-899271414cca42a1a2165168c8403f0e"><dfn title="899271414cca42a1a2165168c8403f0e">Louisiana Purchase</dfn></a>.

From the perspective of Spanish officials, their mission presented a threat to northern New Spain because the western boundary of Louisiana had never been clearly defined. Not only were the explorers surveying the new territory, then, they were assessing the extent of the claims that the United States could reasonably make based on the purchase. Spanish administrators had reason to worry; the Jefferson administration had already attempted to lay claim to Western Florida as part of the Louisiana acquisition.<br/>

After a short imprisonment, he was eventually released by way of San Antonio. His presence in Spanish territory pushed the governments of both Spain and the United States to settle the boundary between their domains through diplomatic means.

The Bourbon Reforms’ shortcomings, coupled with Napoleon Bonaparte’s empire building in Europe, opened the door for independence movements in the Spanish Americas—including that of Mexico. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government struggled to assert authority over its domains and continued to face the threat of U.S. expansion into its northern territories. Under Mexican rule, nuevomexicanos once again found themselves at odds with Comanches, Apaches, Navajos, and Utes. Political leaders in Mexico City imposed constitutions and legislation on New Mexico without providing fiscal or military support against nomadic peoples. Simultaneously, the Santa Fe Trade created connections between New Mexico and the U.S. economy. Despite antagonisms between New Mexico (and the entire northern frontier) and central Mexican policy makers, during their short twenty-seven years under Mexican rule most nuevomexicanos came to identify as members of the Mexican nation. Yet economic, territorial, and political competition in North America meant that Mexico’s hold on its northern provinces was not to last.<br/>
