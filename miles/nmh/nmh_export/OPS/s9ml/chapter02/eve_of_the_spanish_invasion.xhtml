They both fell victim to and adapted to New Mexico’s harsh, dry environment. Their adaptations set the stage for the development of Pueblo cultures and also influenced the Athabaskan peoples that arrived as early as the 1100s. The ability to maintain an adequate water supply for agriculture, as well as the knack for negotiating relations with nomadic peoples were key for Pueblo, and later Spanish, societies. In many respects, such issues defined New Mexico’s histories through the nineteenth century. </p>

For that reason, they were able to maintain some distance from Spanish colonialism. Pueblo peoples, on the other hand, were the direct targets of Spanish ambitions.
