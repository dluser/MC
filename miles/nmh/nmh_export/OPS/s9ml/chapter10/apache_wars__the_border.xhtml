The Chihenne band of the Chiricahua Apache people had dominated the region since the late 1300s or the early 1500s, depending on differing estimates. As we saw in Chapter 2, although scholars do not agree on the time of Athabaskans’ arrival (including all Navajo and Apache bands and clan groups), the Chihenne people consider the region bounded by the Mimbres, Black, Sierra Negretta, San Mateo, and Florida mountain ranges their sacred homeland. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-db259054960e464cbfb496fe06a8a56e"><dfn title="db259054960e464cbfb496fe06a8a56e">Ussen</dfn></a>, the Chiricahua creator, placed them within the territory and entrusted them with its care. </p>

The Chihenne, also called the Mimbreño, Mimbres, Ojo Caliente, or Warm Springs people, organized themselves into local groups which ranged in size from thirty-five to two-hundred members. The Spaniards referred to their home sites, at times semi-permanent, at others more temporary, as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f5a4f913a22f49e7a65653bbde7a0650"><dfn title="f5a4f913a22f49e7a65653bbde7a0650">rancherías</dfn></a>. By the time the United States laid claim to their homelands, Apache peoples had endured various attacks on their place in the region. Even after Mangas Coloradas’ execution, however, few of them realized that the American challenge would prove to be the most devastating of all.<br/>

Victorio led his people far from their homeland at Ojo Caliente, now called Warm Springs in recognition of U.S. control over New Mexico. They ranged between the Blue, Florida, Black, and Mogollon Mountains, and Chihenne warriors led regular raids against settlements in the Chihuahua sierra. In the early 1870s Victorio grew weary of so much wandering and negotiated the return of his people to the Warm Springs Agency under agent <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c130748b37324e52a1d0dc9d4f11c55c"><dfn title="c130748b37324e52a1d0dc9d4f11c55c">Charles Drew</dfn></a>. According to historian Kathleen P. Chamberlain, Drew “was one of the best agents the Apaches ever had, second only to Michael Steck.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-161fed7c1c9c42a897732adb020ef906">5</a> Despite the ongoing problem of Congress’ failure to ratify agreements made between Indian Agents and Native peoples, Victorio settled his band once again in a limited version of their ancestral homeland with an agent that served as a strong advocate.<br/>

Having settled into their lives as American citizens along the border, they actively participated in the religious and political culture of Doña Ana County. In August of 1871 campaign activities for an election between Democrat <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-5dd1446e397e43e1aa68c85107997b8b"><dfn title="5dd1446e397e43e1aa68c85107997b8b">José Manuel Gallegos </dfn></a>and Republican<a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-2edce9657dc144a2996efb853a361be7"><dfn title="2edce9657dc144a2996efb853a361be7"> José Francisco Chaves </dfn></a>inspired a bloody riot that left eight people dead and scores of others wounded.<br/>

Baca had previously requested to retain his affiliation with the Diocese of Durango, despite the transfer of other New Mexican parishes to the Diocese of Santa Fe. In doing so, Baca manifested his continued devotion to the Mexican nation, and his ideas on the significance of the 1871 election brought mesilleros' religious and political loyalties into sharp relief.<br/>

On August 27, 1871, when their respective supporters held rallies on the Mesilla plaza, such accusations only served to fuel tensions. As was common in the culture of nineteenth-century American politics, free whisky and live bands contributed to the charged atmosphere. Each party marched around the town square, chanting slogans that favored their candidate and disparaged the competitor. Violence erupted as the two groups came face to face in front of San Albino’s church. As reported in the <i>New York Times</i>, “the Plaza has been literally drenched with human blood.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-82a411a756f34c14a9f380bf0a66ce19">6</a> Troops from Fort Selden arrived shortly after the carnage had transpired and attempted to quell the disorder.<br/>

Although historians differ in terms of the reasons behind the relocation, the international border provided a barrier of refuge.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-5b202a54d7bd4682ad277c760d2dce4d">7</a> Ninety-six families followed <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-17db8e02e4354d6ca2bbf05c25b43f5f"><dfn title="17db8e02e4354d6ca2bbf05c25b43f5f">Ignacio Orrantía</dfn></a>, U.S. deputy marshal for Doña Ana County, and Fabián Gonzales, Doña Ana County Sheriff, to Chihuahua before the Mexican government had approved their petition for a land grant.

Their efforts to reinvent their community and alter their national status collided with Chihenne attempts to resist dependency on the U.S. government in the setting of the Warm Springs Agency. Despite their desire to remain in their homeland, and despite the best efforts of Agent Drew, Victorio and many of his warriors conducted raids into Chihuahua as a means of maintaining a sense of social and economic independence. They refused to submit passively to a system that required them to subsist on rations that were not always forthcoming.<br/>

Chihuahua Governor <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f963c13ed35741fabb8e1a2715695bfd"><dfn title="f963c13ed35741fabb8e1a2715695bfd">Luís Terrazas</dfn></a> supported the <i>ascensionenses</i>’ (as residents of La Ascensión came to be known) petitions for legal title to the lands they had settled near the Ojo de Federico (Federico Spring) for precisely that reason.

Of course, Chihenne and Nednhi people neither recognized nor accepted the conventions of modern law and boundary demarcation. During the first decade of town construction, conflicts with adjacent landowners and Chiricahuas impeded attempts to construct homesteads and canals. On two separate occasions in 1872, Apache people prevented settlers from building structures and digging canals.<br/>

Reportedly, the sheep were later sold on the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona. In 1878, as Victorio led his band in what proved to be their final campaign to preserve their autonomy against U.S. and Mexican military campaigns, a small group of Victorio’s men assaulted a group of asensionenses led by Juan Zuloaga as they transported goods to Corralitos. After a short scuffle, the Chiricahuas made off with the merchandise and several asensionenses lay wounded. In this instance and several others, militias were hastily organized at La Ascensión to pursue the Apaches. Most of the time, militia members failed to engage the Chiricahuas.<br/>

For them, the border became a barrier to military action because U.S. and Mexican forces were prohibited from crossing into the other nation’s territory in pursuit of Apaches until 1882. Even then, their military activities were greatly limited when in the neighboring nation.<br/>

As headmen like Victorio and Juh came to recognize, their methods of dominance were eclipsed by modern means of claiming lands imposed by both Mexico and the United States. Despite their longstanding supremacy in their traditional homelands, “the Apaches did not follow up their military domination with the creation of a formal boundary survey. Instead of maps and surveys, place names and patterns of movement demarcated the landscape of Apache authority.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-2a524611fac449d797dbe24398a5a38a">9</a> As more and more Chiricahua bands relocated to reservations in Arizona and New Mexico, they continued the practice of raiding northern Mexican settlements in order to supplement their rations and maintain a semblance of independence.<br/>

Indeed, Victorio’s own actions seemed contradictory as he attempted to help his band adjust to their new reality through both violence and negotiation. Although Agent Drew provided consistent support for the Chihennes’ continued claim to their Warm Springs homeland, his successors, John P. Clum and John Shaw, supported a policy of concentration. Beginning in 1876 they initiated a plan to round up Chiricahuas of all four bands and force them to live together at the San Carlos Reservation in southeastern Arizona.<br/>

No Apache band would have left their homeland if not for the use of force. Victorio was hostile to the idea that his people abandon the lands that Ussen had ordained for them, but, like Mangas Coloradas before him, his desire to maintain peace won out. In the summer of 1877, he led his people to a site near Camp Goodwin on the designated San Carlos Reservation, a place that one U.S. officer had referred to as “Hell’s forty acres.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-5439727784c64395ac36b4775d8f6243">10</a> The arrival of most of the Apache bands at San Carlos signaled the emergence of the form of modernization that U.S. politicians and military leaders had envisioned. Now vast expanses of Chiricahua homelands were made available for homesteaders and capitalist development, at the expense of Apache peoples.<br/>

By September malaria had afflicted both young and old, and Victorio concluded that American officials consigned his people to the reservation “so that we will die.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-866031d43bfe48bdaa1cc90048774869">11</a> On September 2, 1877, Victorio and the medicine man <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-e15d82d1fb33481c80ddf0df2db62fc3"><dfn title="e15d82d1fb33481c80ddf0df2db62fc3">Loco</dfn></a> stole horses from White Mountain Apaches also interned at San Carlos and made their escape with as many of their people as could travel.

In southern New Mexico (and throughout the American West), African American men made up as much as half of the military force. African American soldiers serving in the U.S. army following the Civil War were widely known as “<a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f5411c9b05a04a1387d024ee7856625c"><dfn title="f5411c9b05a04a1387d024ee7856625c">Buffalo Soldiers</dfn></a>.” In 1866, Congress passed legislation that reorganized the army. In the process, they designated two regiments—the 9th and 10th—and four infantry units—the 38th through 41st—for black soldiers. Three years later, Congress formed the 24th Regiment from the former 38th and 41st and organized a new 25th from the 39th and 40th.<br/>

Accordingly, they saw action in most of the engagements with Chiricahua peoples. Despite their status as U.S. soldiers, the civilian population consistently opposed the presence of African American military men in both word and deed. Newspaper editors across the territory published derogatory statements against the 9th Cavalry, a black unit which was stationed at Fort Bayard to force Victorio’s band back to reservation life. In one inflammatory rant, the editor of the <i>Thirty-Four</i> (Las Cruces, New Mexico) concluded: “Let the Ninth be dismounted or disbanded . . . [so that its members] might contribute to the nation’s wealth as pickers of cotton and hoers of corn, or to its amusement as a travelling minstrel troupe. As soldiers on the western frontier they are worse than useless—they are a fraud and a nuisance.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-fb5fefc998844ac29b86230c019187fe">12</a><br/>

The prejudice of white settlers remained strong despite black soldiers’ acts of heroism. In 1877 a detachment of the 9th Cavalry engaged Victorio’s band in the Florida Mountains. One officer, six cavalrymen, and two Navajo scouts had been dispatched to intercept the group of about fifty Apaches.

In 1880 when the 9th Cavalry unexpectedly came upon a large body of Apaches that had killed two servicemen, a private was dispatched to bring reinforcements. The African American soldier rode bareback all day and night because a white rancher had refused to lend him a saddle to help him perform his task. Although the rancher may have also refused aid had the soldier been white, settlers typically lent their support to white soldiers that worked to protect their lives and property. As one historian remarked, “the open and latent racism of the late nineteenth century had curious ways of expressing itself.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-e20abd8d9ea242cfbbdff98ac56bae55">14</a><br/>

The Chihenne headman made a deal that allowed his people to return to Warm Springs, but the arrangement did not last. After only a few months back in their homeland, officials in the Indian Department in Washington, D.C., ordered that all Apaches be sent back to San Carlos.

From Chihuahua, governor Luís Terrazas complained that Chiricahua raiding intensified because they received supplies on the U.S. side of the border. The people of the New Mexican town of Monticello (formerly known as Cañada Alamosa, near the Warm Springs Agency) had a long history of cooperation with Victorio, and they continued to supply Chihenne messengers after their flight from the reservation system. At the same time, however, many southern New Mexican ranchers claimed that Apache raiding was sustained by Mexican traders.<br/>

Between the fall of 1879 and the spring of 1880 Victorio led his band back and forth across the border where he and his people took refuge in their sacred mountains and resupplied by calling on their allies in places like Monticello. For a time Victorio also split his forces, and one group of Chihennes, headed by <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-de792ddabb7f44bfad3cfb6e4f60b587"><dfn title="de792ddabb7f44bfad3cfb6e4f60b587">Nana</dfn></a>, engaged Texas Rangers in the Big Bend region.

Most important, the U.S. Consul at Ciudad Chihuahua suggested that Governors Luis Terrazas and Lew Wallace create “a private arrangement . . . for a mutual crossing of the border in order to pursue and fight the Apaches, who, according to the general impression in northern Mexico, ‘have killed one hundred and fifty persons within the past six weeks.’”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-069e7685975d4bb787475d86eafdfdb5">15</a> The governors took the consul’s advice, which proved devastating to Victorio.

Although fall had arrived, conditions in northern Chihuahua continued to be unseasonably dry.

On the morning of October 15, 1880, Terrazas split his forces and surrounded Victorio’s band in their place of refuge. Battle broke out that afternoon and lasted well into the night.

In order to establish the sovereignty of the United States and Mexico on their respective sides of the international border, they dispossessed the Chiricahuas of their homelands, restricting the survivors to the desolate San Carlos Reservation.

Although small-scale raiding continued into the twentieth century, 1886 marked the final conquest of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands from the perspective of each nation’s military. Much of our knowledge of Victorio’s movements comes through Mexican and U.S. military records, as the above discussion indicates. Despite the bias of the records, it is possible to trace the ways in which Chiricahuas attempted to maintain their homelands.<br/>

Chihuahua officials considered asensionenses to be promoters of “civilization” in contrast to “savage” Chiricahuas. On the other hand, Apaches believed that the violence perpetrated against them was little more than a series of savage acts. As always, perspective is crucial to understanding past events. In the case of the “Apache Wars” the consideration of multiple perspectives is particularly important. The viewpoint of Victorio’s people helps us to see the violence of the U.S. conquest of the American Southwest, a reality that is glossed over by more benign explanations based on notions of Manifest Destiny. Ironically, some of the very soldiers that fought to “pacify” the Chiricahuas were themselves victims of racism and discrimination.<br/>

As the Chiricahuas sought to regroup and preserve their culture at the Mescalero agency in hopes of regaining their claim to the Warm Springs in the future (a hope that they have never relinquished), U.S. politicians and developers concluded that New Mexico was now safe for capitalist development. It was no accident that Deming, at the junction of the Atchison, Topeka, &amp; Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines, was incorporated in 1881—just after Victorio’s death. The ethnocentric actions of many American settlers, prospectors, railroaders, and investors reflected their belief that civilizing forces had created stability in New Mexico and the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.<br/>
