The Chief, <i>El Capitán</i>, led a group of about twenty other men, all clothed in buckskins, moccasins, and feather headdresses. They stalked quietly about town, taking <i>mantas</i> (cloaks), tools, and ropes from the buggies, wagons, and cars parked outside the church, and then moved on toward the houses around the town plaza. Among the group of Comanches was El Capitán’s daughter, <i>La Cautiva</i>. She was adorned in a communion gown that blended in with the white color of the intermittently falling snow. </p>

            <figcaption>La Danza de Matachines is a Native American oral tradition, turned dance, of “The Dance of the Moor’s and the Christians.” The tradition was introduced by the Spanish as a masked dance. The dances have deep religious purpose to venerate Mother Mary or saints, but are also performed to worship God, Christ, and the Holy Trinity. This performance of Los Matachines occurred at Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, December 2014.<br/>

They similarly passed by the homes of the ill, calling on the healing power of the young child in their behalf. In the plaza, a band seated in an open wagon played violin and guitar music to accompany both groups’ ceremonies. When the chants concluded, the bells of the church began to ring, accompanied by the rhythm of <i>tombés</i> (hand drums) that called both groups back to the plaza. </p>

El Capitán and the village mayordomo soon agreed on the terms for the exchange of their captives. The mayordomo provided los Comanches with locally produced wine, promised meals, and cash payments in return for El Santo Niño. For his daughter’s surrender, El Capitán pledged that his people would return once again on the community’s saint’s day, or to officiate when a community member was in need of a <i>velorio</i> (death vigil). In the flickering light of the <i>farolitos</i> (small bonfires) the men shook hands and returned their respective prisoners.

Brooks details the means by which a unique borderlands society took shape in New Mexico during the late Spanish Colonial period. Isolated from New Spain’s larger communities, New Mexicans refined colonial customs to meet regional conditions. As Brooks has argued convincingly, New Mexico’s culture and traditions were forged through cycles of violence that were not “solely destructive but [that] produced enduring networks of economic and social relations.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-16e8fc403809453aa0c2f9c0841717fc">1</a> In New Mexico, the cycles of violence were based on conflicts with Apache and Comanche peoples.</p>

Never again would encomienda plague Pueblo peoples. Indeed, in many ways the threat of raids by Apache, Ute, and, by the mid-to-late eighteenth century, Comanche bands pushed Pueblos and Spaniards to make mutual accommodations in order to hold off the nomadic peoples. One historian of the Vargas era has commented that the reconquest paved the way for a society that has perpetuated “an amazing continuity of people and place” in New Mexico.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-3a95ddaceb424b49b60eb85ed4a2c053">2</a> Such has certainly been the case since many present day New Mexicans (especially in the northern part of the state) trace their family histories back to the days of Vargas or even Oñate. What is often forgotten, however, was the means by which this durable culture was forged. This chapter will explore the complicated process of building a durable New Mexican society during the Spanish colonial period.<br/>
