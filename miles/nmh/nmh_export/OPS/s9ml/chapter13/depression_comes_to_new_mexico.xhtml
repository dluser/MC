The decade of the 1920s was characterized by the disenchantment embodied by writers, artists, and reformers. It was also defined by new economic prosperity and wealth for some Americans. That prosperity, however, was unevenly distributed across the nation. While some people drove new automobiles, others continued to walk or use draft animals. Some enjoyed the benefits of electricity and new household technologies, as others continued their day-to-day lives without.</p>

New Mexico reported one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation, as well as high figures for infant mortality during the decade. <i>Partido</i> agriculture continued to dominate rural areas, especially in the north. On the eve of the stock-market crash in October 1929, the average rural family had only six acres of land under cultivation from which they typically made about $100 per year. At that rate, most families barely met subsistence standards.<br/>

In exchange for new loans, they were forced to promise the next supply of wool from their sheep or the next agricultural harvest. In response, the men of many northern New Mexican communities became migratory laborers in an attempt to raise funds to pay their families’ debts. Across the Southwest, by traveling to pick sugar beets, work on railroad construction, or labor in mines and on cattle ranches, nuevomexicano families created what historian Sarah Deutsch has termed “regional communities.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-9e14f6e7274549ecbf2904d9a496ce13">12</a><br/>

Reformers targeted the women not only because they wanted to modernize processes that were typically viewed as women’s work, but also because women had taken on larger roles in their home communities due to the seasonal labor required of men to support their families’ village lifeways. Despite the continued perception that nuevomexicano villages remained pre-industrial, the need for migratory labor highlighted the ways in which local communities were actually incorporated into the national economy.<br/>

In some cases, the ranchers, farmers, or railroad companies simply cut back production. More typically, white men were given preference in the fields that Southwestern hispanos and Mexican migrants had formerly worked. During the 1930s, calls for the return of “alien” Mexican laborers to their home country limited job opportunities across the nation. Despite their U.S. citizenship, administrators in the U.S. Department of Labor, farm owners, and business proprietors drew no distinction between nuevomexicano men and Mexican migrants.<br/>

During the first few years of the Great Depression, nuevomexicanos accounted for 80% of the state’s relief load. Also, those nuevomexicanos who attempted to maintain their seasonal jobs faced the specter of deportation to Mexico as programs to repatriate undocumented Mexican laborers intensified.<br/>

Additionally, unlike californios and tejanos who had lost access to their respective states’ political systems in the nineteenth century, nuevomexicanos preserved a tradition of political participation and access that was further solidified following statehood.<br/>

            <figcaption>A native son of New Mexico, Dennis Chávez served as a Senator from New Mexico from 1935 until his death in 1962. He was the first hispano to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate. During the Great Depression and World War II eras, he worked tirelessly to bring initiatives to New Mexico that directly benefitted the state's nuevomexicano population. <br/>

The Otero and Chávez families had maintained a place in the territorial government, and Governor Octaviano Larrazolo and Senator <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-914da964d7a3491190011f145a7c05ac"><dfn title="914da964d7a3491190011f145a7c05ac">Dennis Chávez</dfn></a> stand out as examples of hispano politicians in New Mexico in the three decades following statehood.

In an effort to prevent people who he termed “alien migratory workers” from entering his state, Colorado Governor <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-3d8bd6d19c5d4702bc81ef5fdd9476f9"><dfn title="3d8bd6d19c5d4702bc81ef5fdd9476f9">Edwin Johnson</dfn></a> declared martial law along the state line with New Mexico. The Colorado National Guard prevented nuevomexicanos and Mexican migrants from traveling to work in the state. Within a few months, however, nuevomexicano laborers petitioned Governor Tingly to take action and he threatened to boycott goods from Colorado. The threat was enough to convince Governor Johnson to back down.<br/>
