In 1894 he took a post as the Superintendent of the Colorado Normal School at Greeley. There, he initiated archaeological investigations of the surrounding area. His first fieldwork took place on the Pajarito Plateau—today’s Bandelier National Monument. </p>

            <figcaption>Archaeologist and educator Edgar L. Hewett played a central role in fusing New Mexico's cultures and history with the tourism industry. He supported the 1906 Antiquities Act at the national level, and he directed the School of American Research (today the School of Advanced Research) in Santa Fe.<br/>

Along with his duties as university president, he became more deeply involved in archaeological fieldwork at sites throughout northern New Mexico. His work inspired him to pursue a doctoral degree in archaeology at the University of Geneva, which he completed in 1903.<br/>

Not long after working to secure the passage of the Antiquities Act, he received a new appointment as the first director of the School of American Archaeology, located in Santa Fe. As director, he focused on promoting academic archaeology to a wide audience.<br/>

In 1922, the School was one of the leading sponsors of an event called the Southwest Indian Fair that brought regional Native American artists to the Santa Fe plaza to display and sell their wares. The fair became an annual event, today known as the Santa Fe Indian Market.  <br/>

At the Museum, the photographs of Jesse Nusbaum supplemented exhibits that featured artifacts from northern New Mexico. Hewett’s promotional efforts attracted tourists to the museum to learn about the area’s ancient past, as well as about the Native American and hispano peoples that continued to inhabit the region.<br/>

Over his lifetime, he had gained a reputation for combining cultural tourism and archaeological research in northern New Mexico.<br/>
