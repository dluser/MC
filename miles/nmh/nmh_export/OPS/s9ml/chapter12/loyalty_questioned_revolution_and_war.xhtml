Peasants lost their communal rights to land and vital resources as the Díaz administration made concession after concession to foreign enterprises in an effort to bring Mexico into the modern, capitalist world. Indeed, the pattern of modernization in Mexico began with the liberal reforms of the 1850s that resulted in the adoption of that nation’s<a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2011/02/the-history-of-the-mexican-constitution/"> Constitution of 1857</a>. By the early 1900s the stress that modernization placed on Mexican peasants and indigenous peoples had pushed them to the breaking point.<br/>

New Mexico Senator Albert B. Fall, as one example, possessed vast interests in Mexico. Unlike other Americans, he was in the unique position to petition the U.S government to take action to protect his Mexican holdings in the face of the revolution. Fall issued countless petitions and conducted a public series of hearings in 1920 to protect his investments.</p>

In 1914, residents of Rodeo, New Mexico—a tiny community in the state’s “boot heel,” petitioned Governor <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-cd8d6ad45cdc46059ea3c7cde502fcdc"><dfn title="cd8d6ad45cdc46059ea3c7cde502fcdc">William C. McDonald</dfn></a> for troops and arms to guarantee protection from Mexican revolutionary violence. The small community was concerned not only that revolutionaries might cross the border to wreak havoc on their town, but also feared “the Mexicans at and around the Mining Camps in Arizona northwest of us that might want to return to Mexico and would probably take this route on account of it being rough and unsettled, and that they would rob and murder on their way, not only for revenge but also to get outfits together.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-9294919c27094a13b4de7ff7921da5df">18</a><br/>

Even President Woodrow Wilson believed that Villa could be the best hope for American-style democracy in Mexico. During 1913, Villa’s success gained him control of the state of Chihuahua, and he briefly served as its governor.<br/>

Although it is unclear how often he visited the office, the presence of his officers there seemed to provide many Columbus residents with a sense of calm in the middle of the revolutionary storm. As Daniel J. “Buck” Chadborn recalled, “To show how cooperative Villa was, he gave me a safe conduct pass for my protection though I didn’t ask for it. It was presented to me in Villa’s Columbus office by two of his right-hand men, Leoncio J. Figueroa and Antonio Moreno.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-522fc81197ae4e5b9dbfd5cead883b00">19</a> Chadborn’s work as a line rider for the U.S. Customs Service, as well as his personal interest in a local cattle enterprise, meant that the gesture was important for building peaceful border relations between villista forces at Palomas and citizens of Columbus.<br/>

After meeting with General John J. Pershing at Fort Bliss in El Paso, the rail entourage proceeded along the Southern Pacific en route to Sonora, where Villa and Obregón were to meet with Governor <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-4178f3e25e60420ba62482048a148c1a"><dfn title="4178f3e25e60420ba62482048a148c1a">José María Maytorena</dfn></a>. The group stopped in Deming for breakfast on the morning of August 27 and residents of the town rushed to see Villa. In accordance with his established tactic of constantly working to build his own reputation, Villa addressed the crowd in Spanish from the deck of his private railcar. He assured the New Mexicans that the violence in Mexico would soon come to an end, and he made a direct appeal to the community’s Mexican residents, most of whom lived in a section of town called “Little Chihuahua.” Villa told them that he wanted “to see the Mexican people united in one solid nation, living in peace and happiness,” and that he forgave any who had formerly been his enemies. He invited them to return to Mexico where he would treat them as members of his own family.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-225a0e443ebb4584866d309b18e9598e">20</a><br/>

Villa failed to adjust his battle tactics accordingly, and by the spring of 1916 was in a desperate struggle to maintain a semblance of his former fame and reputation on the battlefield.<br/>

Although there is no agreement on the particulars, most scholars believe that Villa’s main goal was to provoke a U.S. military expedition into Mexico. From that perspective, Villa gained his objective. Over the next two years, willing recruits joined his forces to fight against Pershing’s Punitive Expedition and in reaction to the notion that the opposing revolutionary forces led by self-proclaimed First Chief Venustiano Carranza had sold Mexico out to the United States in economic and political terms.<br/>

The central business district of the small town lay in shambles, as did the lives of most of its inhabitants. Episodes of violence, loss, and heroism emerged during the battle. William T. Ritchie, who operated the Commercial Hotel with his wife Laura, refused to back down when a group of villistas stormed into the hotel. After attempting to protect his wife and girls, the soldiers forced him out onto the street where he was gunned down along with several other male guests.<br/>

Despite Woodrow Wilson’s reassurance that Mexico’s sovereignty would be honored, Carranza found himself in an untenable position. In order to publicly refute Villa’s unfounded accusation that he was in collusion with the United States, Carranza refused to support the Pershing expedition. Throughout the expedition time spent in Chihuahua between March 1916 and early February 1917, Carranza’s forces actively opposed U.S. forces, most notably at the<a href="http://net.lib.byu.edu/estu/wwi/comment/huachuca/hi1-22.htm"> battle of Carrizal</a> in southern Chihuahua in June 1916.<br/>

Despite the relatively rapid amassment of supplies and men in Columbus, the military did not possess enough trucks to transport the needed ammunition, food, and other items to the Colonia Dublán headquarters. Regular cavalry and infantry units were supplemented with National Guard contingents that were often insufficiently trained for reconnaissance and combat missions.<br/>

Although U.S. forces failed to capture Pancho Villa, they field tested new technologies such as tanks and Curtis JN-4 biplanes, known as “Jennies.” The planes allowed surveillance from the air that had not been imaginable in prior conflicts, but the Jennies had difficulty gaining enough altitude to traverse the mountainous regions of western Chihuahua.<br/>

The idea that New Mexico’s hispano population more closely related with the Mexican nation than the United States had not completely abated, despite statehood a few years earlier. Also, the very public efforts of some New Mexican attorneys to represent Mexican revolutionaries accused of breaking neutrality laws did little to help matters. Elfego Baca, for example, represented Mexican General<a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-5c9d9d154395444b958029dabc8f046a"><dfn title="5c9d9d154395444b958029dabc8f046a"> José Inez Salazar</dfn></a>, accused of breaking neutrality laws by retreating across the border into south Texas to avoid an attack by villista forces in 1913. Baca allegedly participated in Salazar’s escape from an Albuquerque jail. Despite never being convicted on the allegations, Baca was disbarred for his efforts to evade the investigation into his actions.<br/>

They emphasized the reality that the state’s National Guard units that aided the Punitive Expedition were comprised of hispanos. At a rally in Santa Fe, local nuevomexicanos chastised the national press for promoting prejudice “in the minds of the unadvised and thoughtless against a large proportion of our people who are not of the so-called Anglo Saxon descent.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-57a0a81c65904e1da331cb2faded9f63">21</a> As scholars argued by Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, “In truth, the border hostilities heightened nuevomexicanos’ loyalty to the United States.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-ef810255de634c2491b32b01d0189fa4">22</a><br/>

Nuevomexicanos’ experiences at war and on the homefront during the Great War (as World War I was known prior to the Second World War) illustrate the harsh reality that the issue of full inclusion in the Union had not been resolved by statehood.<br/>

They intensified their cultural sensibilities even as they did so. Once again, the Spanish-language press in New Mexico led the way in expressing the connections between nuevomexicano culture and American loyalty. Newspapers like <i>La Voz del Pueblo</i> published poetry in Spanish that emphasized elements of nuevomexicanos’ Iberian heritage, and that were geared to inspire honorable service during the conflict.<br/>

Collective actions, such as rallies and community gatherings to express solidarity with the war effort, marked nuevomexicanos’ assertions of cultural citizenship. At the Spanish American Normal School (today’s Northern New Mexico College) students dressed in military attire and sung patriotic songs in Spanish. In Taos, L. Pascuál Martínez, editor of the <i>Taos Valley News</i> and <i>El Crepúsculo</i>, led a Decoration Day (the precursor to Memorial Day) rally in support of U.S. participation in the Great War.<br/>

Adelina “Nina” Otero-Warren, one of the leading figures of New Mexico’s hispana literary scene, was identified by <a href="http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/resources/">Alice Paul</a>, leader of the Congressional Union (CU)—a national women’ suffrage organization, as a key figure who could promote New Mexican women. In 1917, Otero-Warren took the helm of the New Mexico chapter of the CU. Otero-Warren and other notable members of the nuevomexicana elite, including Aurora Lucero, lobbied state legislators for women’s right to vote at the close of the nineteen-teens.<br/>

Having passed through Congress in 1919, the amendment that granted women the right to vote could not be added to the Constitution until the requisite three-fourths of states had ratified it. Women’s groups, like the one headed by Otero-Warren, played instrumental roles in securing the amendment’s ratification. At the national level, women’s suffrage leaders encouraged nuevomexicanas to support the war effort as a means of also promoting their own cause.<br/>

Along with Otero-Warren, who also headed the auxiliary of the First Judicial District and chaired the state-level Red Cross, other women joined the battle for the right to vote. Across the state, they contributed their efforts to simultaneously illustrate their loyalty to the United States and their dedication to the idea of political equality.<br/>

Accordingly, “Mrs. J. M. Díaz” was listed as the woman who led efforts to produce food, plant victory gardens, and collect Liberty Bonds among northern New Mexicans. In Taos County, Juanita G. Mares and Juanita Saavedra de Martínez headed efforts to collect Liberty Bonds. Women field agents, including Gertrudes Espinoza, served as experts on the preservation of meats, fruits, and vegetables. As we will see in Chapter 13, most of the field agents assigned to rural New Mexico in the World War I era were Anglo American, and their biases shaped the types of reforms that were recommended and eventually carried out under New Deal agencies.  <br/>

According to Gonzales and Massmann, she “single-handedly convinced wavering U.S. Congressman William Walton to support woman suffrage, and she successfully pressured the Hispanic members of the state house of representatives to vote in favor of it.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-cd8b127a144a40d882df88bee112e6b7">24</a> Other women’s rights advocates, principally those connected to Otero-Warren’s Republican political circles, also petitioned the New Mexico legislature.<br/>

New Mexican legislators debated whether or not to petition for a segregated nuevomexicano unit as young men went off to service, both through volunteerism and the conscription required by the Selective Service Act of 1917.<br/>

Hernández added the caveat that local hispanos were strong citizens, “when [they] understand things, but those living in the remote villages, or upon stock ranches, have not the reading matter at hand.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-b96a3e6b8db34008a97bb33b15c22554">25</a> Taking the accusations much further, a letter published in the <i>North American Review</i> claimed that a treasonous conspiracy against the United States was in motion in New Mexico. The populace’s continued use of Spanish was the supposed evidence for the alleged plot, and the letter’s author claimed that the Penitente brotherhood was a secret society that dictated political, economic and social affairs in New Mexico.<br/>

Fall, demanded the letter’s retraction. In the state legislature, Larrazolo, then speaking as a prominent Las Vegas lawyer, argued that a separate regiment for nuevomexicanos was necessary that segregated units would provide comfort to New Mexican servicemen. Hernández also supported the separate regiments, but on the grounds that nuevomexicano young men were not sufficiently assimilated into American culture to thrive in integrated units.<br/>

In addition, some, like editor L. Pascual Martínez, continued to advocate for cultural citizenship on the home front. He specifically argued that the federal government also support state-level improvements in educational and economic opportunities.<br/>

Although the implication was that entry into the Union would bring full U.S. citizenship rights to the state’s hispano, indigenous, African American, and Asian residents, such was not the case. Pancho Villa’s raid on Columbus and U.S. participation in World War I proved to many nuevomexicanos that such hopes were in vain. Within a decade of statehood, perceptions of New Mexico’s people as ignorant, backward, and un-American persisted in many sectors of the nation.<br/>

During the war, nuevomexicanas successfully advocated for suffrage and shortly thereafter achieved the right to serve in public office. Hispano politicians also maintained a strong role in state politics as advocates for the rights of New Mexicans. Governor Octaviano Larrazolo was one of many “native sons” to whom New Mexicans appealed when they felt that their citizenship rights had not been properly protected.<br/>

Such claims were based on the idea that poverty was an accepted cultural way of life for the supposedly pre-industrial peoples of New Mexico. Paradoxically, members of the famed artist colonies of Taos and Santa Fe, as well as rural reformers, simultaneously promoted the idea of New Mexico’s peoples as embodying the notions of purity and simplicity that could cure the ills of the modern age, and also as peoples in need of modern models of efficiency. Their perceptions of New Mexico furthered the incorrect notion that the Great Depression did not greatly impact the state’s people, but the New Deal provided artists and reformers with resources they needed to record, preserve, and reproduce cultural goods among Pueblos, Navajos, and hispanos. The Depression era will be addressed in the next chapter.<br/>
