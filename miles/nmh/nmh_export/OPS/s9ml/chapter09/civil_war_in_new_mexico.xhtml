At first, the strong military presence was to secure New Mexico as U.S. territory. Between 1848 and 1853 troops remained to guarantee the promise made in Article XI of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that the U.S. military would prevent nomadic peoples from making incursions into Mexico. U.S. military leaders quickly realized, however, Article XI was virtually impossible to enforce. In the negotiations over the Treaty of La Mesilla in 1853, James Gadsden also achieved the annulment of Article XI along with the addition of the Mesilla strip to the United States.</p>

After 1853, the federal army erected forts and attempted to make good on the promise. Over the next several years, various military commanders and federal Indian Agents came and went. At times the same man filled both posts; at others the offices were separated. Governor John M. Washington, for example, served as both Indian Agent and Military Governor in 1848 and 1849. His first priority was to wage war against the Navajo people in an attempt to settle long-standing conflicts between the Diné and nuevomexicanos.<br/>

Following one skirmish in 1849, six Navajos were killed during an attempt to negotiate peace. One was the esteemed headman <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-99028897e602497d81253599480edf86"><dfn title="99028897e602497d81253599480edf86">Narbona</dfn></a> who was scalped by a U.S. militiaman. Washington’s successors followed their own distinct policies toward the territory’s indigenous peoples. Some, like Major <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f98a39042fe3476e96de774d791d09e5"><dfn title="f98a39042fe3476e96de774d791d09e5">John Munroe</dfn></a> and Lieutenant Colonel <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-f1f56ff7342d4c67a59d7c4125520b27"><dfn title="f1f56ff7342d4c67a59d7c4125520b27">Edwin Vose Sumner</dfn></a>, considered the barren New Mexico territory to be a waste of American military effort and resources. Others, like Indian Agents James S. Calhoun and Michael Steck, recognized the diversity of peoples and interests in the territory and they forged positive relationships with several bands of Navajos and Apaches.<br/>

Although several bands of Chiricahua Apaches under the leadership of <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-bdce7237c98847fb80f1a1abf78b91e1"><dfn title="bdce7237c98847fb80f1a1abf78b91e1">Mangas Coloradas</dfn></a> struck friendly relations with Kearny in 1846, relations quickly eroded. In January 1852, U.S. forces established Fort Webster near the Santa Rita del Cobre mine (near present-day Silver City). Chiricahua warriors saw the new fort as an unsolicited and unwarranted infiltration of their homelands. Despite attempts to solve the conflict through diplomacy, a state of war existed between several Chiricahua headmen and U.S. forces throughout the early 1850s.</p>

These included Fort Union on the lands of the Llaneros band of the Jicarilla Apache people, Fort Conrad to the south of Socorro, Fort Fillmore near Mesilla, Fort Stanton among the Mescaleros, and Fort Defiance in the Navajo heartland. The forts suggested Americans’ readiness to use violent force against nomadic peoples, and at times the threat of violence worked at counter purposes to Indian Agents’ overtures. Nearly 4,000 soldiers manned New Mexico’s military outposts by the close of the 1850s.<br/>

Fewer than 2,000 men, under the command of Colonel <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-19d04edcf09d4cc1995760ba89c66d52"><dfn title="19d04edcf09d4cc1995760ba89c66d52">Edward Richard Sprigg Canby</dfn></a>, remained to defend New Mexico in the name of the Union. Fearing a Confederate invasion through the southern part of the territory, Canby directed the bulk of his men and resources to Forts Fillmore, Craig (which replaced Fort Conrad in 1854), and Stanton. Leaders from both sides of the conflict argued that the majority of New Mexicans supported their side. Under the direction of Colonel<a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-5c1f08b67cca4e59b661abd7b8f4bea2"><dfn title="5c1f08b67cca4e59b661abd7b8f4bea2"> Henry Hopkins Sibley</dfn></a>, Lieutenant Colonel John R.

Mesilleros certainly were not happy that yet another invading force had occupied their town. Despite Sibley’s hopes to capitalize on disaffection with American control of Mesilla, his actions reaffirmed locals’ fears that his was just another occupying force. In December 1861, he declared martial law, ostensibly to deter “desperadoes, gamblers, &amp;c” that “incited innocent citizens of the valley to rebel against the proper authorities.” [sic]<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-7d1aafaf7e044e57983af3a7c0ec44d8">5</a> His justification, however, suggests that mesilleros considered the Confederate troops as invaders, rather than liberators as Sibley liked to imagine.<br/>

Similarly, Colonel Canby declared that nuevomexicanos not join Union ranks because they carried “no affections for institutions of the United States.”<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-31241b8daa2744b3a85580c5d0cdf2a4">6</a> Yet, following the shock of Baylor’s victory in Mesilla, pragmatism pushed Canby to encourage nuevomexicanos to join his forces. Despite the need, convincing nuevomexicanos to sign up was easier said than done. Many of them, like the mesilleros, felt ambivalence toward U.S. citizenship.<br/>

Rather than speak of patriotism or the chasm between North and South, he instead cast the struggle as one between Texans and nuevomexicanos. Due to earlier events like the 1841 <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-c35f601a318343d8a5f8fd3b4d77c8f1"><dfn title="c35f601a318343d8a5f8fd3b4d77c8f1">Texan-Santa Fe Expedition</dfn></a>, nuevomexicanos held deep animosities toward Texans. As Connelly recognized, many nuevomexicanos had associated the concept of American identity with the hated image of the Texan. As historian Anthony Mora has demonstrated, “Texan identity often implied a racial meaning for Mexicans”—including nuevomexicanos.<a href="../remarks.xhtml#key-ed21f4ad56894c2b93ee07f5cf2fe060">7</a> Although nuevomexicano enrollment was never as widespread as Canby had hoped, the revision of the conflict’s significance persuaded many to join his ranks.<br/>

He was correct that Sibley was planning a new offensive. The Confederate general had served with the U.S. army in Taos prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. Due to his time in the territory, Sibley was able to convince Confederate President Jefferson Davis of the value of a New Mexico campaign. The Confederacy desperately hoped for a transcontinental rail connection to the Pacific to counter the rail supremacy of the North. Additionally, California offered the promise of gold and a silver lode had recently been unearthed in Colorado. New Mexico promised to be the ticket to all of that potential wealth.<br/>

In part, Sibley was not the man for the job (his own men considered him to be pretentious and overly preoccupied with luxury), and the concerted effort of Union forces—with or without nuevomexicano support—proved too much for his attempt to conquer New Mexico. Still, at first Sibley’s forces seemed to have the upper hand. At the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/battle-of-val-verde">Battle of Valverde</a> in February 1862 they battled Canby’s forces to a draw. Canby refused to surrender Fort Craig and, rather than press the issue, Sibley bypassed it and continued northward to Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Both proved to be<a href="http://newmexicohistory.org/people/confederate-army-in-santa-fe"> easy targets</a> for the Confederate army.<br/>

Despite mesilleros’ and other nuevomexicanos' general feeling of support for the Union, once again the California Infantry represented another occupying force. Over the next year, the troops sapped local resources at the expense of locals. In response, some mesilleros relocated south to towns in northern Chihuahua. Most, however, stuck it out.<br/>
